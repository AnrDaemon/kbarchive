SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Windows NT on an IBM PS/ValuePoint P60/D Pentium machine, the
computer may hang with a STOP message.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs just prior to the GUI-portion of the Windows NT 3.1 Setup
procedure, and may be due to a conflict with the Maxtor MXT-540 AT drive
firmware.

WORKAROUND
==========

To correct this problem, obtain a firmware upgrade from IBM's BBS at (919)
517-0001. The files to download are P60NT.DSK (from Directory area 36) and
LDF.COM (from Directory area 10). After downloading the two files to your
hard-drive do the following from the MS-DOS command prompt:

1. Run LDF.COM (extracts two files: LOADDSKF.EXE and PRODAID.TXT)

2. Insert a blank formatted floppy disk into Drive A and type:

   LOADDSKF P60NT.DSK A: <enter>

   This uncompresses files from P60NT.DSK to the disk.

3. Use the floppy disk you just created to boot the IBM PS/ValuePoint P60/D
   Pentium machine.

4. After the system boots, a report on its progress is displayed. Do not power
   down the system until instructed to do so by the appearance of a power cycle
   message.

5. When you receive the power cycle message, turn the system off.

6. Proceed with the Windows NT version 3.1 installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM firmware utility upgrades a Maxtor MXT-540 AT drive to firmware level
6.0 for the IBM PS/ValuePoint P60/D Pentium machine. The utility works on only
the first upgradable MXT-540 AT drive it finds, so if you have more than one
MXT-540 AT drive, apply the upgrade to each drive, and power-cycle the system
after each run. For more information on the upgrade utility, contact IBM
Hardware Technical Support at (800) 772-2227.
