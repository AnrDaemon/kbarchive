TITLE   :PC Win: Err Msg: Undeliverable Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER::3.0b,3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if there are more than
66 network names defined, the following error may occur when you send mail:

   Undeliverable Mail

This problem applies to gateway users, as well as external postoffice users.

CAUSE
=====

The NETWORK.GLB file is used to define any external postoffices or gateways the
postoffice can address mail to. Network names are defined by the Mail
Administrator program and a new record is added to this file every time a new
network name is defined. Gateway names are defined and added to this file when
the gateway is installed.

If the NETWORK.GLB file contains more than 66 network names, any mail sent to the
remaining subsequent network names will cause Mail to return an "Undeliverable
Mail" error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0b and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which
includes MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).
