SYMPTOMS
========

If you have added many SoundBits custom events, you may find that a general
protection (GP) fault (usually in USER.EXE or KRNL386.EXE) occurs when you run
either the Sound option in the Windows Control Panel or the Set Sounds option in
Media Browser. Windows may also return you to the MS-DOS prompt.

This problem occurs if you have more than 107 custom event entries in the
[Sounds] section of the WIN.INI file. A custom event is any event in Windows
(such as Windows Start, Windows Exit, Word Minimize, and so on) that has a sound
attached to it.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this problem, make sure you do not have more than 107 custom event
entries in the [Sounds] section of your WIN.INI file.
