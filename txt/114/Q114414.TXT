When printing to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 520 or 560 printer, you may
receive the following error message:

1. Run Control Panel from the Main group and choose the Printers option.

2. Choose Setup.

3. Set the paper size to the desired setting.

4. Return to Creative Writer.

The Creative Writer document should now print properly.
