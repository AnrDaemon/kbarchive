TITLE   :LM 2.2/2.2b Server Fails With CSLIM=8A1E/CSLIM=8A0E
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================


SYMPTOMS
========

The failure CSLIM=8A1E is reported on LAN Manager 2.2 systems; CSLIM=8A0E on LAN
Manager 2.2b systems. Serious network problems may be observed at the time of
failure, including frame misalignments, corrupt packets and excessively high
network utilization. Multiple traps across multiple servers may occur
simultaneously, since all servers receive the same corrupt packets.

CAUSE
=====

The network protocol driver receives a truncated DLC administrative frame (RR)
because an adapter or bridge malfunctions under network stress and generates a
truncated packet that contains a valid cyclical redundancy check (CRC) but
incomplete NetBEUI data.


RESOLUTION
==========

NETBEUI.OS2 and NETBEUI.EXE for MS-DOS have been fixed so that truncated frames
are now rejected even if they pass a CRC check by the network adapter driver.
However, the network device responsible for creating the truncated packets must
be repaired to assure proper network performance.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in OS/2 LAN Manager versions 2.2
and 2.2b. A fix has been created and is included in: CSD00.089. Contact
Microsoft Product Support Services for information on its availability.
