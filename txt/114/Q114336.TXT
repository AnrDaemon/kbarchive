TITLE   :Missing MS At Work PC Fax Address Option in WFWG 3.11 Mail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 3.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to create a new address entry in the Windows for Workgroups 3.11
Mail program, the Microsoft At Work PC Fax address option is missing.

NOTE: Even when this option is missing, you should not encounter any problems
receiving or sending faxes.

CAUSE
=====

This situation can be caused by a missing FAXNSP entry in the MSMAIL.INI file or
a corrupted FAXNSP.DLL file in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the MSMAIL.INI file located in the Windows directory and verify that the
NAME= entry under the [Providers] section contains Faxnsp. Below is an example
of how this section should look.

      [Providers]
      Name=Pabnsp MSSFS Faxnsp

If the [Providers] section appears to be correct, it is possible that FAXNSP.DLL
is corrupted. Expand a new FAXNSP.DLL from Disk 6 (of the 3.5- inch set) or Disk
8 (of the 5.25-inch set) of Windows for Workgroups 3.11. For example, to expand
a new copy of the file from a disk located in the A drive to a Windows directory
located on the drive C, you would use the following:

   expand a:\faxnsp.dl_ c:\windows\system\faxnsp.dll
