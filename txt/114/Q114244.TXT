TITLE   :Unable to Upgrade Service Pack 2 On Magneto Optical Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading Windows NT version 3.1 to Service Pack 2 on a Magneto Optical
drive or any removable drive, the Update program reports there is not enough
space available when there is space left on the disk.

CAUSE
=====

The Win32 API that determines drive type informs the Update program that the
drive is DRIVE_REMOVABLE; the Update program considers it to be a floppy, so the
free space check ends up incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

No resolution is available at this time.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
