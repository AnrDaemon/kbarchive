The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

More icons can be added to your application group after the Setup program is run
for a distributed application created with the FoxPro for Windows Distribution
Kit. You can add these icons by using dynamic data exchange (DDE) to send
commands to the Windows Program Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After running the Setup program for your distributed application, users may want
to add other icons and program groups for help or README files. By using DDE to
send commands to the Windows Program Manager, you can create a new program group
or add items to existing program groups.

The following example shows how to initiate a DDE channel to the Windows Program
Manager, create a program group called "My Application", and add an item with a
particular icon (in this case the Help icon that comes with FoxPro).

      iChannel = DDEInitiate("Progman","Progman")
      = DDEExecute(iChannel,;
       "[Additem(c:\myapp\readme.txt,tty,;
       c:\foxprow\goodies\bitmaps\fox\help.ico,0)]")
      = DDETerminate(iChannel)

This program can then be compiled into an .EXE file. At the end of the Setup
program, you can tell your users to run this .EXE file after installing the
application.
