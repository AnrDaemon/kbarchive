PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail System Selector, provided with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows, won't let you copy the postoffice list or move your personal
message file locally.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Mail for Windows looks for the Mail system database in one of three
places: The location specified by the ServerPath= entry in the MSMAIL.INI file,
the drive specified by the ServerDrive= entry in MSMAIL.INI, or, if neither
entry exists, the current directory of drive M.

However, the Mail Remote for Windows System Selector, only looks at the
ServerPath= entry in the MSMAIL.INI file and does not provide the copy or move
functionality if the entry is invalid or does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add a ServerPath= line to the [Microsoft Mail] section of your MSMAIL.INI file.
Specify a drive and path (for example, M:\MAILDATA), a universal naming
convention (UNC) path, or a Novell path.
