TITLE   :Setup: TCP/IP Binding Defaults To All Installed NIC's
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing the TCP/IP protocol on a Windows NT version 3.5 Workstation or
Server with more than one network interface card (NIC) installed, you are forced
to initially bind TCP/IP to every installed NIC. During setup you cannot bind
TCP/IP to a single NIC. This is a change in behavior from Windows NT version
3.1.

CAUSE
=====

Under Windows NT 3.1, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) supported only one adapter, so
it would bind to the first adapter. Under Windows NT 3.5, NBT supports multiple
adapters and by default the network control panel applet (NCPA) binds all
transports to all adapters.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you don't want TCP/IP on a particular segment, go to the network control
panel and disable the appropriate TCP/IP bindings.
