TITLE   :PRB: SET COLOR TO Results in Differing Shades of Gray
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:2.5b,2.5c,3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c 
 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The default desktop color is a different shade of gray than the default color
pair displayed for scheme 1 in FoxPro for Macintosh.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the default color set is actually using an RGB
value for the color information. The color pair listing returned by scheme(1)
returns information in color pair letters, which are an approximation of the
current RGB settings. The SET COLOR TO n/w* command uses a different set of RGB
values to represent gray.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the default desktop color programmatically, issue the following
commands:

      SET COLOR TO
      CLEAR

For more precise control over the colors, use RGB values instead of color pairs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start FoxPro for Macintosh.

2. Issue the following commands in the Command window:

         SET COLOR TO
         CLEAR
         ?SCHEME(1)

   Note that the desktop is a pale gray. The first color pair listed for scheme 1
   is "N/W*".

3. Issue the following commands in the Command window:

         SET COLOR OF SCHEME 1 TO "n/w*"
         CLEAR
         ?SCHEME(1)

Note that the desktop is now a darker shade of gray, although the color pair
information returned by the second ?SCHEME(1) command is identical to the color
pair information returned by the first command.

commands in the "Language Reference."
