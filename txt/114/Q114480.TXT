TITLE   :BUG: SET COMPATIBLE or Catalog Manager Changes MEMOWIDTH to 80

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The value returned by SET('MEMOWIDTH') changes from 50 to 80 when FoxPro
executes the SET COMPATIBLE DB4 or SET COMPATIBLE ON command.

CAUSE
=====

The SET COMPATIBLE DB4 and SET COMPATIBLE ON commands will change the default
value of MEMOWIDTH from 50 to 80. However, the command SET COMPATIBLE OFF does
not restore MEMOWIDTH to its original value of 50. This problem will therefore
occur when the SET COMPATIBLE DB4 or SET COMPATIBLE ON command is issued.

This problem also occurs when a program is executed through the Catalog Manager
and the dBASE Program check box is selected. When the Catalog Manager executes a
program as a dBASE program, it issues a SET COMPATIBLE ON command, which causes
the value of MEMOWIDTH to change from 50 to 80 as described above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore MEMOWIDTH to the default value of 50, issue the following command
after the SET COMPATIBLE DB4 or SET COMPATIBLE ON command has been executed:

      SET MEMOWIDTH TO 50

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, issue this command:

         ? SET('MEMOWIDTH')

   Note that the value 50 is returned.

2. In the Command window, issue these commands:

         SET COMPATIBLE ON<BR/>
         ? SET('MEMOWIDTH')

   Note that the value 80 is returned.

3. In the Command window, issue these commands:

         SET COMPATIBLE OFF<BR/>
         ? SET('MEMOWIDTH')

Note that the value 80 is returned; MEMOWIDTH is not restored to 50.
