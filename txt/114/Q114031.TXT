TITLE   :PC Ext: External 3.2.5 Doesn't Accept SendHomeOnly Parameter
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.2.5 of the External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) ignores the
SendHomeOnly parameter when it is used either in an EXTERNAL.INI file or on a
command line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2.5 of the External
Mail program. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the -AH command-line parameter in place of SendHomeOnly .INI parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Set up two postoffices and map drive letters to them (M:=Net1/PO1,
   N:=Net2/PO2).

2. Configure an external postoffice definition on Net2/PO2 to Net3/PO3 direct
   via a modem connection.

3. Create the following EXTERNAL.INI file and copy it to PO1's INI directory:

   [External]
   DriveHomePO=M
   DrivesDirectPO=MN
   SendHomeOnly

   [External-MTA1]
   CommType=async
   CommScript=HAYES24
   AsyncCommPort=com1

4. Compose a message from PO2 to a recipient on PO3.

5. Run the External Mail program using the following command line:

   external /instancename=mta1

   The External Mail program will attempt to make an asynchronous (modem)
   connection to PO3, even though PO3 is not the home postoffice.

6. Remove the SendHomeOnly parameter from the EXTERNAL.INI file and run the
   External Mail program using the following command line:

   external /instancename=mta1 /sendhomeonly

   The External Mail program attempts the same asynchronous connection as in Step
   5.

7. Run the External Mail program again, using the following command line:

   external /instancename=mta1 -ah

   The External Mail program does not attempt to make the asynchronous connection
   to PO3.
