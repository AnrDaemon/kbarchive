The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft CD Sampler, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

To run the Microsoft CD Sampler successfully, Windows must be running in
256-color mode. If you try to install or run the CD Sampler while Windows is
running in either 16-color mode, 32K-color mode, 64K-color mode, or 1.6 million
color mode, it may run very slowly, not function correctly, or generate error
messages.

In some cases, you may receive an erroneous error message indicating that you
need to run in either 16-color or 256-color mode. This is incorrect. You must be
running in 256-color mode for the CD Sampler to install and function correctly.
It is also recommended that you use a video resolution of 640 x 480.
