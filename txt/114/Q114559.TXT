SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT PostScript printer driver user interface has an option to force
all jobs sent to a particular PostScript printer to be converted to an
encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file instead of being sent to the print device.
This option is disabled (grayed out) and cannot be enabled.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view this option, create a PostScript printer in Print Manager, select this
printer, and choose the Properties option from the Printer menu. Next, select
the Details button, then select the Job Defaults button, then select the Options
button. In the Print To dialog box, the option that indicates a choice of
printing to Printer or Encapsulated PostScript File is permanently set to
Printer; the Encapsulated PostScript File option is unavailable.

This option was built into previous Windows PostScript drivers to let people
generate EPS graphics from any application, including applications like Notepad
that do not natively have code to create EPS graphics. This was an important
feature in earlier versions of Windows, when few applications could create EPS
graphics natively. Today, most people who want to generate EPS graphics use more
sophisticated applications that can generate these graphics by themselves.
