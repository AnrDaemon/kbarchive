SUMMARY
=======

The subroutine GetLocalHardDrivesList() takes one parameter, szSymbol$. This
parameter is used to specify a symbol name that will receive the hard drive
list. The parameter is not a destination string for the return value. The
correct way to use the function is to specify a symbol name, such as "drives",
and then use GetSymbolValue() or GetListItem() with GetListLength() to obtain
the local drive letters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a .MST script that demonstrates how to use this function:

   '$include 'setupapi.inc'
   '$include 'msdetect.inc'

INIT:

    GetLocalHardDrivesList "drives"

       '' Obtain and display list of local hard drives.
       Drives$=GetSymbolValue ("drives")
       pause Drives$

       '' Cycle through list and display them one at a time.
       for i%=1 to GetListLength ("drives")
           pause GetListItem ("drives", i)
       next

QUIT:

       end
