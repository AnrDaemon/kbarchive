TITLE   :PRB: Setup Toolkit Error "Parser out of memory"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit

SYMPTOMS
========

When the setup program created by the Microsoft Setup Toolkit is reading the
script, the following error message is given:

   Parser out of memory

CAUSE
=====

This means that the script interpreter has exceeded its memory limit on some
memory object. The memory object could be a data segment, a code segment, or one
of the parser tables. There is no way to know which memory object it is. The
chance of running out of interpreter table space is rare -- you will almost
always run out of code or data space first.

RESOLUTION
==========

Try breaking the script into multiple scripts and try running them
independently. This can be done by using Microsoft Test's RUN command. For
example:

   RUN "_mstest script1.mst"

Other tricks that can bed used to reduce the size of the code and data segments
include:

1. Eliminate excess code, by using only those .INC files that are needed. For
   example, if you are not using the registration database, do not include
   MSREGDB.INC.

2. Within each .INC files, comment out unused functions.

3. DLL calls are expensive in terms of code generation. If a script makes
   frequent calls to a function in a DLL, it might be better to place the call
   to that function in a wrapper function/subroutine within the script file.
   This will reduce memory consumption.

4. Finally, consider using text files to hold your strings and read them in at
   run time.
