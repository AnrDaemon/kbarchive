Common Messaging Calls (CMC) is a client application programming interface
(API) that provides functions to send and receive messages across a variety
of computer platforms. CMC parallels the Simple MAPI function calls for
functionality and the number of function calls.

CMC applications work not only with Microsoft Mail, but also with Microsoft
Mail services for Hewlett-Packard (HP) OpenMail, Banyan VINES, and AT&T
EasyLink, as well as any other services that become available in the future
such as for MS-DOS, Macintosh, OS/2, and VIM. CMC enables developers to use
the same client interface on multiple platforms without the need for
program modification.

CMC currently functions under the Windows and Windows for Workgroups
operating systems. It is not currently supported by Windows NT. MAPI
version 1.0 will be shipped with CMC as the cross-platform mail-enablement
API.

You can obtain the official CMC specification by faxing a request to XAPIA
at (408) 257-1478. There is no charge to developers or users who want to
receive Microsoft CMC. The CMC SDK is currently available on the Microsoft
Software Developer's Network (MSDN) CD (Level II).
