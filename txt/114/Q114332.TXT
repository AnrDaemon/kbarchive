TITLE   :BUG: L2029 Error Truncates Debug Information
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:5.5,5.6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.5, 5.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to debug an application that was built with unresolved externals will
fail with varying results.

Codeview will issue the following warning:

   CV0103 Warning : relink 'C:\TEST.EXE' with the current linker

This indicates that the debug information should be packed with the CVPACK
utility. Because the linker fails to add unpacked debugging information to the
executable, CVPACK will generate the error:

   CVPACK : fatal error CK1013: incompatible version of debugging information.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by creating a shell for each function call
which is unresolved. A function shell avoids problems that can occur if the
function is accidentally called.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Linker versions
5.5 and 5.6 for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Linking an application without the linker switch /ONERROR:NOEXE produces an
executable. CVPACK will not have been run because of the fatal L2029 error.
Since the executable contains truncated debug information, CVPACK will fail.

Windows applications that contain errors of this nature are invalid. Codeview and
the IDE debugger correctly responds by not loading the debuggee.
