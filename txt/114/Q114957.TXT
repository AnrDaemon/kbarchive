The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Fine Artist for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Fine Artist prints in Landscape orientation only. It is not possible to print in
Portrait orientation from Fine Artist.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although it is possible to go to the Control Room (by pressing "CTRL+SHIFT+A"
(without the quotation marks) or "COMMAND+SHIFT+A" (without the quotation
marks)) and change the paper orientation to Portrait, Fine Artist always
defaults back to Landscape and prints in Landscape. This is by design.
