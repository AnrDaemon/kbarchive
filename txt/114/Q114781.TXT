The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, versions 2.5b, 2.5c, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

FoxPro's SQL - SELECT command automatically opens any tables called in the FROM
clause of the command. If any of these tables have an associated structural
.CDX, that .CDX file is automatically opened. This is the standard behavior of a
structural .CDX. However, any nonstructural .CDX files or .IDX files associated
with the tables in the projection list must be explicitly activated in order for
Rushmore to use them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Rushmore requires indexes in order to operate. If no suitable index is
available, FoxPro will create an index. Creating the index will take some
additional time, which reduces the benefits of Rushmore's query speed.

To ensure the best performance possible when you use tables with nonstructural
.CDX and .IDX indexes, open the tables and related indexes prior to issuing the
SELECT command. FoxPro has no way to associate and automatically open .IDX files
or nonstructural .CDX files for Rushmore.

Steps to Demonstrate Behavior
-----------------------------

To see how indexes affect Rushmore's performance, do the following:

1. Issue the following commands in the Command window:

         USE customer
         COPY TO testrush
         USE testrush
         APPEND FROM customer   && re-execute this command until ;
                                   there are several thousand ;
                                   records in the testrush table. ;
                                   The point is simply to create ;
                                   a file large enough so that the ;
                                   timing difference is noticeable.

         INDEX ON company TO testrush
         CLOSE ALL

2. Issue the following SELECT command in the Command window:

         SELECT * FROM testrush WHERE company = "A"

   Note the query time in the status bar.

3. Close all the tables and run the query with both TESTRUSH.DBF and
   TESTRUSH.IDX active:

         CLOSE ALL
         USE testrush INDEX testrush
         SELECT * FROM testrush WHERE company = "A"

Note the query time in the status bar.
