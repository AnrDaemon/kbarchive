======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are passing variables to a SELECT - SQL command, you may have to call
the command and programmatically pass criteria to it rather than coding such
criteria directly. In many such instances, you may not want to use macro
substitution.

The programs below show how to pass variables to a SELECT - SQL command without
using macro substitution.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The programs below are provided as an example of calling a FoxPro SELECT - SQL
command with the selection criteria contained in variables. They employ name
expressions and the EVALUATE function instead of macro substitution.

FoxPro 2.x Example
------------------

   *This program uses the Customer table from the Tutorial.
   SET TALK OFF     && stop echo to screen
   x="State"
   y="FL"
   SELECT * ;
      FROM customer;
      HAVING EVALUATE(x) = (y) ;
      INTO CURSOR crsrFlorida
   BROWSE

Visual FoxPro Example
---------------------

   *!* This sample uses the Customer table in:
   *!* VFP 3/5 -- HOME() + "Samples\Data"
   *!* VFP 6 -- HOME(2) + "Data"

   SET TALK OFF     && stop echo to screen
   x="Country"
   y="UK"

   SELECT * ;
      FROM CUSTOMER;
      HAVING EVALUATE(x)=(y);
      INTO CURSOR crsrUK
   BROWSE

The output will contain records where the contents of the field whose name is
contained in variable x are equal to the contents of variable y.
