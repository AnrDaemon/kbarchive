TITLE   :PRB: NOEDIT Clause of BROWSE Command Ignored in Program Mode
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a, 2.5b, 2.6 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Macintosh, version 2.5b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The NOAPPEND and NOEDIT|NOMODIFY clauses of the BROWSE command have no effect on
programmatic editing commands such as APPEND BLANK or REPLACE.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you are calling a BROWSE command programmatically in a situation where
adding a record may be desired but editing is not, issue the BROWSE command with
a WHEN clause that returns FALSE so that editing any new or existing records is
impossible. For example:

   BROWSE NOAPPEND NOEDIT WHEN .F.

NOTE: Although this command will prevent interactive editing of the BROWSE,
remember that programmatic editing is still functional. The only way to prevent
programmatic editing is to open the database in a read-only format (with the
NOUPDATE clause).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In the Command window, issue the following commands:

         USE <database name>
         BROWSE NOAPPEND NOEDIT
         APPEND BLANK

2. Try to enter data in the newly added record.

3. Try to edit any previously existing record.

Since the NOAPPEND and NOEDIT|NOMODIFY clauses of the BROWSE command are intended
to affect only the interactive use of a BROWSE, programmatic editing is still
possible.
