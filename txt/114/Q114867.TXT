The information in this article applies to:

 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Net2Com utility included with the Windows NT Resource Kit uses only LANA 0
as its protocol path to the network. Other protocols such as Remote Access
Service (RAS) may use the same LANA number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LANA is a number given to a specific path from the application layer through a
protocol stack, to a specific network card.

To check what LANA number a protocol is using:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the Network icon.

2. From the Installed Network Software list box, choose NetBIOS Interface, and
   then choose the Configure button.

3. The NetBIOS Interface dialog box displays the Network Route and the LANA
   Number. Please note:

      NBF is NetBEUI
      NBT is NetBIOS over TCP/IP
      NWBLINK is NetBIOS over IPX
      RASHub is a RAS link

4. Make sure that the Network Route for RAS is not set to LANA 0. To ensure
   connection between the workstation and the server, it is important that LANA
   0 on both computers use the same networking protocol (NetBEUI, TCP/IP, IPX,
   and so on).
