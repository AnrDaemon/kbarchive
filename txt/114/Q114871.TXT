The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Bookshelf 1994 with Central Point's PCTools Desktop version 1.0 or
2.0, you may receive a general protection (GP) fault when you try to move
QuickShelf (or, in some cases, if you just click the QuickShelf title bar). The
following error message may appear

   QSHELF caused a General Protection Fault in module <unknown>
   <Address>:QSHELF will close."

where <Address> is a memory address, such as 2527:003FA.

NOTE: Clicking or moving QuickShelf with PCTools on the system also causes the
system to restart in some cases.

RESOLUTION
==========

This can be corrected by adding "6=MSQSWClass" (without the quotation marks) to
the [Desktop.Subclass.Exclude] section in the WNUSER.INI file (in the CPS\DATA
directory) as shown below:

      [Desktop.Subclass.Exclude]
      1=PSFloatC
      2=LauncherWClass
      3=GWScopeWin
      4=CIV
      5=CIVDIALOG
      6=MSQSWClass

NOTE: Numbers 1 through 5 should already be there.

WORKAROUND
==========

Other resolutions include the following:

1. Use PROGMAN.EXE as your shell.

   -or-

2. Use Small Buttons in QuickShelf (this removes the ability to move
   QuickShelf).
