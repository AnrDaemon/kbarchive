SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to update fields in a screen while a user is
scrolling through a list box that is based on a database field (a "prompt field"
in the Screen Builder in FoxPro 2.x for Windows).

MORE INFORMATION
================

FoxPro 2.x for Windows
----------------------

When a list box is set up as a prompt field in the Screen Builder or is based on
a POPUP defined with PROMPT FIELD, scrolling through the list box also moves the
record pointer in the database. In order for other @ ... GET fields on the
screen to be updated as the record pointer is moved, insert the following code
in the WHEN clause of the list box:

      SHOW GETS
      RETURN

The WHEN clause is reexecuted as the user moves through the list box, which
allows this code to update those fields.

Visual FoxPro for Windows
-------------------------

In a form, use the following code for the list box's WHEN clause:

      THISFORM.REFRESH
      RETURN
