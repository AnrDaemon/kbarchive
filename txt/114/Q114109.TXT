TITLE   :Mail Spell Checker Defaults to Windows NT Subdirectory
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbother

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the path for your custom dictionary in the Registry to be either a
UNC path or a local drive path (other than the default Windows NT subdirectory),
when you start Mail, and then choose Spelling from the Edit menu after you
compose a new message, your changes are lost and Mail changes the path back to
your Windows NT default directory.

According to the Windows NT Resource Kit, Registry Entries for Microsoft Mail,
you can change the path for your custom dictionary, by changing the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\MS Proofing Tools. This does not work.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server. This problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.5.
