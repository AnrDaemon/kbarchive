TITLE   :TrueType Fonts Are Randomly Dropped with Kyocera F-800
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Kyocera F-800 or F-800a, there will be TrueType fonts
randomly missing throughout a document. The behavior is consistent when you
print the same document, but characters may be dropped when you print new
documents. You will be unable to predict which characters will drop when you
print different documents. The problem does not seem to occur with TrueType
fonts 12 points and greater, but consistently occurs with smaller fonts. There
also appears to be a second problem where the first character downloaded does
not print. The same character will not print if it appears later in the
document. This behavior does not exist in Windows 3.1 because TrueType
downloading is handled differently.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.5.

You might be able to work around the first problem by installing more printer
memory or printing TrueType fonts as graphics (to do this in Windows NT, do not
select the Download TrueType fonts option in Printer Setup from within the
specific application). You might also avoid the problem by using larger TrueType
fonts. (greater than 11 points) or by resetting the printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT and Windows NT
Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.5.
