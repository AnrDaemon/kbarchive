TITLE   :Cannot Find DC with Multiple Installations on Single Computer
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you have installed multiple configurations of Windows NT on a single
computer using the same machine name for each installation, when you start
Windows NT, it cannot find the domain controller.

CAUSE
=====

When you run multiple installations of Windows NT on a single computer using the
same machine name for each installation, one of these instances can modify the
secure channel account password. This keeps the other instances from
re-establishing communications with the domain controller.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To prevent this, set this registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters

to this value:

   DisablePasswordChange = [REG_DWORD] 0x01

- or -

use different machine names for each installation.
