SUMMARY
=======

The following basic serial port settings displayed in Control Panel reflect the
default values for serial printers only:


   Baud rate
   Parity
   Word length (data bits)
   Stop bits
   Type of port handshaking

These settings can be changed by choosing the Ports icon in Control Panel.
Changes are reflected in the [ports] section of the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The settings for baud rate, parity, word length, stop bits, and handshaking in
the Control Panel Ports dialog box define the default values for serial
printing.

To change these settings, run Control Panel and choose the Ports icon. Select the
port that you want to change and choose the Settings button.

The Ports settings displayed in Control Panel are recorded in the [ports] section
of the WIN.INI file. The following are the default values:

      [ports]
      COM1:=9600,n,8,1,x
      COM2:=9600,n,8,1,x
      COM3:=9600,n,8,1,x
      COM4:=9600,n,8,1,x

The following syntax is used for these settings:

   Portname:=baud rate,parity,word length,stop bits,flow control

The possible values for flow control are "x" for Xon/Xoff, and "p" for hardware.
If no value is listed, no flow control is selected.

IMPORTANT: These settings have no effect on modem communications, which are set
by the individual application. Changing the baud rate in Control Panel, for
example, does not change the speed available in a communications application,
such as Terminal. Additionally, these Control Panel settings have no affect on
the Microsoft At Work PC Fax utility included with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.
