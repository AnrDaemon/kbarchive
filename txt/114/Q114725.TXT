SYMPTOMS
========

Several new forms to the forms database of Windows NT when you install an Apple
LaserWriter IINTX printer driver, including "Com10 Envelope Center Fed" and
"Monarch Envelope Center Fed." Adding new forms to the database is expected
behavior, however, the right margin values for these two forms are specified
incorrectly in the forms database as 169091.02 inches and 169090.89 inches,
respectively.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Windows NT Workstation and Server version
3.51.

To work around the problem after these forms are added to the database, manually
redefine the right margin value and save your changes.

STATUS
======

Advanced Server version 3.1. This problem was corrected in Windows NT
Workstation or Server version 3.51.
