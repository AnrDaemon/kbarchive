SYMPTOMS
========

Compiling a C++ source file which uses a forward reference to a struct in a
function prototype will cause the compiler to generate the following error:

   error C2129: static function 'Function' declared but not defined

The sample code shown below can be used to illustrate this problem. Note: the
error does not occur if the same file is compiled as a C source file.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. In C++, a tag not previously seen is entered in the current
scope. In the sample code, the ForwardRef appearing in the parameter list is a
different struct than the one defined afterwards.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, move the declaration of the struct so that it is
located before the function prototype.

Sample Code
-----------

      /* Compile options needed: /Tp to force this to be compiled as a C++
      *                          source file.
      */ 

      static void Function( int i, struct ForwardRef * frPtr );

      // To work around this problem place the following declaration before
      // the Function prototype.

      struct ForwardRef
      {
          int data;
      };

      void main( void )
      {
          struct ForwardRef *frPtr;
          int j;
          Function( j, frPtr );
      }

      static void Function( int i, struct ForwardRef *frPtr ){}
