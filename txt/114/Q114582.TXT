The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 uses the BDYx.P00 convention
for attachment naming, so you can use Notepad or Microsoft Word for Windows to
open *.P00 files. Version 3.2 also sends an additional bodypart containing the
associated filename, which the recipient can use or ignore. This is a non-X.400
feature in the Microsoft product only.

Some recipients cannot use the associated filename. The X.400 gateway has no
concept of attachment: it cannot retain an associated filename for a bodypart
and has no standard way to indicate the name of an attached file, but it does
recognize messages that can be partitioned into bodyparts.

If a foreign X.400 system sends a message and attached file to a Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks recipient, X.400 encodes the contents of the attached file in a
message bodypart. In other words, rather than "re-name" attachments, it assigns
a name to an un-named bodypart in the message. Originating X.400 systems have no
standard way of sending a filename.
