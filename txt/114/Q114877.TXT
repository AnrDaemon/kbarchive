SYMPTOMS
========

The coupon labeled "$100 U.S./$135 CDN Upgrade rebate by mail!" located on the
front of the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit version 2.0 box incorrectly
states that in order to collect the $100 U.S/$135 CDN rebate, you must provide
proof of ownership of both the Microsoft Access Distribution Kit version 1.1 and
Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0. This information is incorrect.

RESOLUTION
==========

To collect the rebate, you need only provide proof of ownership of either the
Microsoft Access Distribution Kit version 1.1 OR Microsoft Visual Basic version
3.0.

MORE INFORMATION

         Distribution Kit version 1.1 and Microsoft Visual Basic
         programming system version 3.0.

      B) A photocopy of your dated sales receipt for Microsoft Access
         Distribution Kit version 1.1 and Microsoft Visual Basic
         programming system version 3.0.

The criteria should read:

         Distribution Kit version 1.1 or Microsoft Visual Basic
         programming system version 3.0.

         Distribution Kit version 1.1 or Microsoft Visual Basic

collect the rebate.
