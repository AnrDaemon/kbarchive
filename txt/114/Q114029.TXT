TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Set Access Privileges Option Unavailable/Disabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot choose the Set Access Privileges option from the Options menu (the
option is unavailable [gray]). No error messages appear and both Mail and
Schedule+ seem to work correctly.

This problem only occurs when you run Schedule+ with Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11 while using Microsoft At Work PC Fax.

CAUSE
=====

If you select the FAX Only option when setting up Microsoft At Work PC Fax
instead of the FAX And Email option, Mail works correctly only if it was set up
before the At Work PC Fax software. However, Mail runs Schedule+ offline only,
disabling any of the online options in Schedule+.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the FAX Only option is selected, the transport entry in the SCHDPLUS.INI
file is changed to the following value:

      ScheduleTransport=TRNOFF

To activate the Set Access Privileges option, change the line to read as
follows:

      ScheduleTransport=TRNSCHED.DLL

When you restart Schedule+ after making this change, the offline calendar file
will update the server's copy of the calendar file and you can then use the Set
Access Privileges, Work Online, and Work Offline menu options.
