TITLE   :Err Msg: Invalid Setting in DBLSPACE.INI: FIRSTDRIVE=...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Disk Operating System
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:6.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive the following error message when you start your machine from the
hard disk drive

   Invalid setting in the DBLSPACE.INI file: FIRSTDRIVE=<*>

where <*> is ASCII character 25 (decimal), which is the down-arrow
character.

In addition, your compressed drives do not mount at startup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the DBLSPACE.BIN file is not in memory (for example,
because you pressed CTRL+F5 or CTRL+F8 at startup) and you run any of the
following DoubleSpace commands and then reboot.

   DBLSPACE /AUTOMOUNT=0|1
   DBLSPACE /DOUBLEGUARD=0|1
   DBLSPACE /ROMSERVER=0|1
   DBLSPACE /SWITCHES=F|N|FN


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, manually mount your DoubleSpace drive(s) by using the
DBLSPACE /MOUNT command. You must do this for each compressed drive. For more
information about this command, type "help dblspace /mount" (without the
quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt.

NOTE: The DBLSPACE.EXE command should be on your uncompressed drive if you were
able to execute the DoubleSpace commands listed under in the "Cause" section of
this article. However, if it is not there, you must manually expand it from the
original MS-DOS disks.


STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
