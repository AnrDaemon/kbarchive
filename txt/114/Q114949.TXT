======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.6, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FOXTOUCH() function can be used to change the date/time stamp on a specified
file. This article describes the FOXTOUCH() function.

NOTE: For backward compatibility, Visual FoxPro still supports FOXTOOLS.FLL
(included in earlier FoxPro versions), the Visual FoxPro API library that allows
calls to 16-bit .DLL functions. However, in Visual FoxPro, the DECLARE command
is the preferred method for calling .DLL functions.

WARNING: The FOXTOUCH() function is not supported by Microsoft Technical Support
either electronically or by telephone. This function may not work in future
versions of Visual FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FOXTOUCH() function changes the time stamp of the file specified with
<filename>. If the time stamp parameters are not specified, the file is
stamped with the current system information.

The syntax of the FOXTOUCH() function is described below:

   FOXTOUCH (<filename>,[<ExpN1>,<ExpN2>,<ExpN3>,<ExpN4>,<ExpN5>,<ExpN6>])

   <filename> - The name of the file to be modified <ExpN1> - The
   year to be stamped <ExpN2> - The month to be stamped <ExpN3> -
   The day to be stamped <ExpN4> - The hour to be stamped <ExpN5> -
   The minute to be stamped <ExpN6> - The seconds to be stamped

Example
-------

   SET LIBRARY TO foxtools.fll
   =FOXTOUCH( "myfile.txt", 1984, 2, 10, 13, 20, 6)

This will change the date/time stamp of the file MYFILE.TXT to:

   2/10/84  1:20:06pm

The FOXTOUCH() function is not contained within FoxPro itself. The FOXTOUCH()
function is contained within FOXTOOLS.FLL. To use this function, you must first
use the SET LIBRARY TO command to set the library to FOXTOOLS.FLL.

Under FoxPro 2.x, for more information about FOXTOOLS.FLL please see the
FOXTOOLS.WRI file, which is located in the GOODIES\FOXTOOLS subdirectory of the
FoxPro for Windows directory. In Visual FoxPro, see FOXTOOLS.HLP in the
VFP\TOOLS directory.

The FOXTOUCH() function was added to FOXTOOLS.FLL version 1.03. FOXTOOLS.FLL
version 1.03 is shipped with FoxPro version 2.6 for Windows. The FOXTOUCH()
function does not exist in versions of FOXTOOLS.FLL that shipped with earlier
versions of FoxPro for Windows.
