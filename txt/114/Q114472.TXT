TITLE   :PRB: Viewer Errors 6181 and 6182
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Software Development Kits

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to compile an RTF file with the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, the
following errors occur:

   error 6181 specified word breaker unable to break word

   error 6182 failure on DLL breaking function

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if the TEMP environment variable is not set to a valid
drive and directory or if that drive does not have enough space.

RESOLUTION
==========

At a command prompt, type

   set

in order to determine the settings of the environment variables. If this
environment variable is not set or is not set correctly, do the following 2
steps:

1. create a directory (for example, C:\TEMP)

2. set the environment variable at the command prompt (set TEMP=c:\temp)

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If the TEMP environment variable is set to a remote drive, Viewer will
ignore the TEMP setting and place temporary files in your Windows directory
instead.

It is not a good idea to set the TEMP environment variable to the root directory.
Windows has a limit on the number of files which can be created in the root
directory. Page 12-4 of the "Viewer Authoring Guide" states the following:

   If the drive on which this directory resides is not large enough to hold the
   files, the compiler will report error messages and eventually halt
   compilation.

The error messages that will be generated are these errors, 6181 and 6182.
