SUMMARY
=======

In July 1993, video board manufacturer Video Seven of Fremont, California,
closed its doors after being declared insolvent. Video Seven was founded in 1983
and was well known for its popular line of PC video boards. At the time Video
Seven shut its doors, it was partially owned by Spea Software AG, a German
graphics board manufacturer.

Spea Software AG of Starnberg, Germany, controls the license of the Video Seven
product name and currently sells several products under the Spea/Video Seven
brand name in Europe. Product support for most of the newer Video Seven products
(for example, VEGA VGA, VRAM II, 1024i Plus, WIN.SWIFT, WIN.PRO, and WIN.VGA)
released in the United States can be obtained by contacting Spea Software AG in
Germany.
