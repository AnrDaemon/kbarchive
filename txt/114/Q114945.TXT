TITLE   :Sytos Fails Adding Volumes with Enhanced-mode 1742 Controller
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
SYMPTOMS
========

When the Adaptec 1742 tape controller is running in enhanced mode, Sytos may
perform tape backup correctly but trap when trying to add a volume back from
tape. If you attempt to view a catalog, you may also have to wait hours to
obtain it.

CAUSE
=====

These problems are related to configuring the Adaptec 1742 controller in
enhanced mode, and running older versions of Sytos software.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Upgrade the Sytos software to the newest version. (Currently 1.38)

2. Configure the Adaptec 1742 controller to run in Standard mode, thereby
   forcing it to use the AHA154x.BID file as the device driver.

3. Use a known good version of the AHA154x.BID file (AHA154x.BID dated
   11/15/91).
