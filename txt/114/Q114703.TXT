TITLE   :DEL *.* Through Gateway Services for NetWare Leaves Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect from an OS/2 LAN Manager 2.2 workstation to a Windows NT share
that is redirected to a Novell NetWare 4.0 server resource, where the Windows NT
server is running Microsoft Gateway Service for NetWare and you attempt to
delete all the files in a directory with the command:

   DEL *.*

the files are not deleted. This does not happen from a Windows NT client.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
------------------

1. From a Windows NT computer, NET USE to NetWare 4.0 server shared resource

2. From the Windows NT computer, NET SHARE the redirected drive

3. From an OS/2 LAN Manager 2.2 Workstation or Server (OS/2 v1.3), NET USE to
   the shared resource on the Windows NT computer

4. From the OS/2 computer, type "COPY C:\OS2\*.* F:\TEST" (without the quotation
   marks and where F: is the drive mapped to Windows NT redirected share)

5. From the OS/2 machine, type "MKDIR F:\TEST\TEMP"

6. From the OS/2 machine, type "COPY F:\TEST\*.* F:\TEST\TEMP"

7. From the OS/2 machine, type "CD \TEST\TEMP"

8. From the OS/2 machine, type "DEL *.*"

9. From the OS/2 machine, type "DIR" and you will still see files.
