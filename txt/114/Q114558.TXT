The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you create or configure a printer in
Windows NT Print Manager:

   Could not set the device mode for this printer: The system cannot find the
   file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can result from entries in the Windows NT Registry that list
printer driver files that no longer exist on disk.


WORKAROUND
==========

Work around this problem by doing one of the following:

 - Expand or copy the correct driver files back to their proper directory.

   -or-

 - Manually edit the Registry, and remove each driver subkey that references
   driver files that are no longer present.

Note that there is a Registry subkey for each printer defined in Print Manager,
and these subkeys reference the driver subkeys, so if you choose the second
workaround, also remove each printer subkey that references a driver subkey that
you deleted. These printer subkeys are in the Registry location:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments
   \WindowsNTx86\Drivers\version-1.

For more information on manually editing the Registry to remove printer drivers,
