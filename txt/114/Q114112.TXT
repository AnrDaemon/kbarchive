======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft At Work PC Fax appears to successfully receive faxes; however, once
the transmission is completed, you receive blank pages or a

   Bad Error

error message.

CAUSE
=====

Blank pages or the "Bad Error" message occurs when you are using a Class 2 modem
and the bit order of the fax is reversed from the order in which Microsoft At
Work PC Fax expects it.

You also receive blank pages if you have seperator pages selected in Print
Manager.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct these problems, add the following line to the [COMx] section of the
EFAXPUMP.INI file:

   PreAnswerCommand=AT+FBOR=0

If this does not correct the problem, restore the line to the following:

   PreAnswerCommand=AT+FBOR=1

MORE INFORMATION
================

"PreAnswerCommand=AT+FBOR=0" allows Microsoft At Work PC Fax to read the bits in
the order they are received.

"PreAnswerCommand=AT+FBOR=1" allows Microsoft At Work PC Fax to read the bits in
reverse order of how they are received.
