The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0, used with:
    - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1 Professional 
    - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1 Advanced Server 
    - Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1 Server 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.5, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to add a system or user data source name (DSN) to a Microsoft
Access database, the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup window may not appear after you
select Microsoft Access driver from the drivers listed in the Create New Data
Source window.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the following invalid registry entries:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\Engines\Jet
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\Engines\Jet


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete these registry keys if they are found on your
system.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Registry Editor (RegEdit.exe or RegEdt32.exe).

2. Locate one of the following keys:

    - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI

    - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI

3. Add a new key Engines underneath the above selected key.

4. Add a new key Jet underneath the newly created key Engines.

5. Start ODBC Administrator.

6. Click either the User DSN or System DSN tab and then click Add to create a
   new DSN for an Access database.

7. Select Microsoft Access driver from the Create New Data Source window, and
   then click Finish. You are returned to the original ODBC Administrator
   window, instead of to a new ODBC Microsoft Access Setup window.
