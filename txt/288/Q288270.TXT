TITLE   :ASP Returns Continuous "Include File Not Found" Errors
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open and read an include file, Active Server Pages (ASP) may return the
"Include file not found" error message continually, even though the file exists,
and the condition that caused the error no longer exists.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the file handle is never closed when the error
occurs, and the next attempt to use that handle results in an error. This
problem has only been reported when the content is on a Universal Naming
Convention (UNC) share.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
