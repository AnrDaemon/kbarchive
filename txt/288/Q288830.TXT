In the Document Map pane (on the View menu, click Document Map), an item that

Replace the column break or page break with a section break (for example, Next
Page section break):

1. On the View menu, click Normal.

2. Find the column break or page break, and then delete it.

3. On the Insert menu, click Break.

4. Under Section breaks, click to select the type of break you want (for
   example, "Next page"), and then click OK.

Method 2: Use Blank Lines Before and After the Column Break or Page Break
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert a blank line before and after the column break or page break in your Word
document. Then apply the Normal style to the blank lines.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
