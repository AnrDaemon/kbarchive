TITLE   :XADM: No Traditional Spanish Templates in Exchange Server 5.5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER::5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Spanish-language version of Microsoft Exchange Client or Microsoft Outlook
may be unable to download the offline Address Book from an English-language
Exchange Server 5.5 computer. This problem may occur even if the
Spanish-language templates have been installed by using the Spanish-language
Templates.csv file from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the traditional Spanish-language templates are not
installed on the Exchange Server computer. These templates are listed as Espanol
in the Details Templates container in the Exchange Server Administrator program.
You may see a template called Espanol/moderno, which is the modern
Spanish-language template. For most Spanish-language clients to work properly
with an English-language Exchange Server computer, both the traditional
Spanish-language and modern Spanish-language templates must be installed on the
server.

The traditional Spanish-language templates are not included in the
Spanish-language Templates.csv file that is included with Exchange Server 5.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, import the Templates.csv file that is included on
either the Spanish-language Exchange Client version 5.0 CD-ROM or the
Spanish-language Microsoft Outlook 98 CD-ROM, which includes both the Espanol
and Espanol/moderno templates.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
