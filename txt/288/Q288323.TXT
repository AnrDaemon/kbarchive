TITLE   :Web Browsers Receive "HTTP 401.5"  Using NT Challenge/Response
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Windows NT Server Service Pack 6a, Web Browsers, you
can receive the following error message:

   HTTP 401.5
   Unauthorized: Authorization failed by ISAPI/CGI app.

This error can occur when Internet Information Server (IIS) is set to require
Windows NT Challenge/Response on a Web site or virtual directory.

CAUSE
=====

HTTP Keep-Alives are required for Windows NT Challenge/Response to work
properly. If the HTTP Keep-Alives Enabled check box has been cleared, the IIS
metabase has not been updated with the correct setting, and therefore,
Keep-Alives are still enabled. Windows NT Challenge/Response continues to work
properly.

After you install Windows NT Server Service Pack 6a, the metabase setting is
corrected to match the HTTP Keep-Alives Enabled check box. Because Windows NT
Challenge/Response requires HTTP Keep-Alives, the now disabled setting prevents
Windows NT Challenge/Response from working correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. In the Internet Services Manager, right-click the Web site for which you want
   to enable Windows NT Challenge/Response, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Performance tab, and the click to select the HTTP Keep-Alives
   Enabled check box.

3. Click OK.
