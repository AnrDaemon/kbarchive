The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 sends an "Open SSCP RSP Error"
response to an emulator's request to start the 257th 3270 session that is
configured to use any available resource. For example:

NOTE: Err1:0055 indicates "SSCP Connection Already Open" and Err2:0003 indicates
"Control Block / Resource Shortage".

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because all 3270 logical units (LUs) are assigned to user groups
under "configured users" rather than LU pools on the SNA Server or Host
Integration Server.

Users can specify an LU and receive active sessions beyond the 256 active LUs in
the group. This is because the emulator is not asking for a list of LUs for that
group, but instead is asking for permission to use that particular LU.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following illustrates the problem:

1. One user group assigns more than 1,000 LUs.

2. A client requests all available LUs for the user record (or, in some
   emulators, requests only those LUs that are explicitly configured).

3. The server sends back all 1,000-plus LUs.

4. The client processes all the LUs (even ones in use) and either picks the last
   LU not in use and attempts to use it or stops at some predetermined number
   because its internal cache cannot handle any more than what was assigned to
   it.

5. The client stops processing the list of LUs when the limit is reached.

The following illustrates what would normally happen when a client requests an LU
from a pool:

1. The client sends a request to the server to see what LUs are assigned to the
   user.

2. The server sends back the pool name.

3. The client sends back the pool name, requesting an LU.

4. Server acknowledges the pool name and sends an LU from the pool that is free.
