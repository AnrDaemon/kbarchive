======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) can return instances of the Win32_Share
class indefinitely. This problem can occur until you restart the computer or you
stop the Winmgmt service. When this problem occurs, the Winmgmt exhibits high
levels of CPU usage.

On the Systems Management Server (SMS) clients, this problem may cause symptoms
such as high CPU usage by the Winmgmt service and the creation of large hardware
inventory MIF files by the SMS Hardware Inventory agent. The MIF files may be so
large that they exceed the default maximum MIF file processing size that is
defined in SMS 2.0 (5,000,000 bytes) and may not be processed.

CAUSE
=====

If more than approximately 256 shares exist on the computer, querying for
instances of the Win32_Share class by using WMI may be reiterative.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
