PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a domain where you are not a domain administrator or a member
of the Administrator group, you may find that the shortcuts in the Startup group
do not work. The following error message may appear when you type a password:

   Incorrect password or unknown user name for \\LocalComputerName\c$

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an administrator creates shortcuts and places them in
the Default User profile and All Users profile folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, log on as a domain user or local user, and then delete
and recreate the shortcuts in the Startup group.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, log on to the group by using the username and
password for the domain administrator or local administrators account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you start Task Manager from the %Windir%\System32 folder, no error message
appears. You also can start other Windows programs directly from their
executable files.
