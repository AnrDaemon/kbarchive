======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Systems Management Server (SMS) script file (Smsls.bat) to
install the SMS-based client components, the workstation may not successfully
install the components, and an error message may be logged in the Wn_logon.log
file:

   ======= Logging initialized for module
   "C:\Windows\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Boot32wn.exe" =======
   SmsclientPath (from "C:\Temp") is ""
   SmstempClientPath (from "C:\Temp") is ""
   ERROR: No server path specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when there is an extra space after the Set Temp variable
in the Autoexec.bat file. You can verify this extra space if you review the
Wn_logon.log file and the following entry has been logged:

   Wrote "SmsserverPath=\\Usnycns01\Smslogon" into file "C:\Temp \Smsboot1.ini",
   iRet = 1

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, remove the extra space after the "Set
Temp=C:\Temp" line in the Autoexec.bat file, restart the workstation, and then
log on with an account that runs the Smsls.bat logon script.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Smsman.exe program is run from the logon point, you may observe the
following entry in the Wnmanual.log file:

   ERROR: Load of DLL CliEx32.dll failed
   (C:\Windows\Ms\Sms\Core\Bin\Cliex32.dll), 1157
   ERROR: Initializing CliEx failed error code 1157

NOTE: The 1157 error may also be caused by a corrupted Clicore.exe program on the
logon point.
