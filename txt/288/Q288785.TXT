SUMMARY
=======

The DB2OLEDB Provider supports only the forward-only cursor type when used with
an ADO server-side cursor. The DB2OLEDB Provider does not support keyset,
dynamic, or static cursor types for server-side cursors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft OLEDB Provider for DB2 that ships with SNA server 4.0 or with Host
Integration Server supports the forward-only cursor type. When you open a
recordset using ADO with a server-side cursor (specifying
CursorLocation=adUseServer), you cannot use the ADO MoveLast or MovePrevious
functions. You may use the MoveFirst and MoveNext functions.

If you open a client-side cursor with ADO (specifying
CursorLocation=adUseClient), you will always get a static cursor. In this case,
because you are using the ADO Client Cursor Engine (CCE), you will be able to
use MoveLast and MovePrevious, as well as MoveFirst and MoveNext, with a
Recordset object.

NOTE: To get an updateable recordset with DB2OLEDB provider with a server-side
cursor, you must specify the FOR UPDATE or FOR UPDATE OF clause with the SELECT
statement. For additional information, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
