TITLE   :Server for NIS Does Not Start After You Demote a DC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::2.0,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg kbnetwork kbtool w2000sfu

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run Dcpromo.exe on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based domain controller
(DC), one or more of the following events may be logged in the event log, and
the server for NIS and possibly the server for NFS services may not start or
function correctly:

   

 - Event Type: Error
   Event Source: nissvc
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 8210
   Description:
   Unable to create the RPC service.

 - Event Type: Error
   Event Source: nissvc
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 8198
   Description:
   Server for NIS yppush service has stopped.

 - Event Type: Error
   Event Source: nissvc
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 8211
   Description:
   Server for NIS did not start. Error: The specified server cannot perform the
   requested operation. (0x3a)

 - Event Type: Error
   Event Source: Service Control Manager
   Event Category: None
   Event ID: 7000
   Description:
   The NfsRdr service failed to start due to the following error:
   The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur after a Windows 2000-based DC (with the Services for Unix
version 2.0 Server for NIS) is demoted to a member server by using Dcpromo.exe.
NIS support requires that Services for Unix (SFU) be installed on a DC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the SFU 2.0 MSI Wizard to remove Server for NIS
before you demote the Windows 2000-based DC. If you have other SFU NIS DCs and
you want to restore the computer as an SFU NIS server, promote the server back
to a DC, and then reinstall SFU NIS to resolve the issue. Because the NIS data
is stored in Active Directory, it will still be available from the other
remaining DCs in your domain.
