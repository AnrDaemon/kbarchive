TITLE   :FTP Failed Login and Bye Command Cause Dr. Watson in Inetinfo
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbiis500prod2web kbProd2Web

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to the Internet Information Server (IIS) FTP Service
by using the DOS FTP client, the system returns a "Home Directory inaccessible"
message. When you return to the FTP prompt, and use the Bye command to exit the
FTP client, a Dr. Watson occurs in the Inetinfo.exe service.

NOTE: The credentials that are passed work correctly when you attempt to log on
to other resources, such as domain logins or network shares.

CAUSE
=====

For the IIS Services (WWW, FTP, NNTP, and SMTP) to function properly, it is
imperative that the corresponding DLL files for the service are the same
version. For example, if a computer is running Windows NT Server with Service
Pack 5 (SP5), then the version for W3svc.dll, Infocomm.dll, Ftpsvc2.dll must all
have the same modified dates. If they do not have the same modified dates, the
out of date DLLs in Inetinfo.exe will cause an Access Violation to occur. If the
service that you are attempting to use is not running the proper version, the
Inetinfo service will return a Dr. Watson (C0000005) error.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, apply the latest service pack to the server (currently
SP6a).

NOTE: IIS 4.0, which is included in the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP), was
released before SP4. To successfully update problems in products that were
included in the NTOP, Microsoft has bundled all fixes in subsequent service
packs. Therefore, to ensure that all services are running the latest version,
you must run the latest Windows NT service pack.
