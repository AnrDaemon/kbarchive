SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate e-mail messages from a Novell GroupWise 5.5 post
office on a computer that is running the Internet Addressing (GWIA) component
and the GroupWise 5.2 client, the addresses for the migrated messages may appear
truncated.

CAUSE

The GroupWise 5.2 client cannot translate the GWIA addresses because this
functionality was added in GroupWise version 5.5.

==========

A third-party solution, UniAccess from ComAxis Technology may be used to export
the GroupWise mail folders and address books to the personal folders (.pst) in
Microsoft Outlook.
