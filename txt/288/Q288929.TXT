=======

This sample demonstrates how to drag and drop files in and out of applications
by using OLE drag and drop. It shows how to drag a file to your application and

MORE INFORMATION
================

Developers have generally used WM_DROPFILES message to handle files dropped from
other applications. This message is sent when the user drops a file on the
window of an application that has registered itself as a recipient of dropped
files.

On the other hand, your application can respond to mouse event to support
dragging files to other applications. OLE drag and drop supports this
functionality. Both techniques involve passing a global HDROP (drop structure
handle) from the source to the target. WM_DROPFILES passes this handle in the
WPARAM value. OLE drag and drop passes the HDROP with the data object.

In the sample project provided in this article, CFileDropListCtrl is the most
important class. Its OnDropFiles method shows how to deal with the file that is
dragged in. The OnLButtonDown method shows how to drag file to another
application.
