TITLE   :New 802.2 Connections Always Appear as Ethernet in SNA Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0 SP4
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport kbsna400sp4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you add new Data Link Control (DLC) 802.2 link services to an SNA Server
configuration after you apply SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), all
connections that use these link services appear to be Ethernet connections even
if Token Ring adapters are being used for the physical connection.

The new connections have an Ethernet icon (T-shaped tap) when the connections are
viewed in SNA Server Manager. The Connection Properties dialog box in Manager
also indicate that the connection type is Ethernet.

NOTE: New connections that are created after you apply SNA Server 4.0 SP4 show
the correct network icon if they are configured to use DLC 802.2 link services
that were installed before SP4.

CAUSE
=====

When you install SNA Server 4.0 SP4 on Windows NT 4.0, SNA Server 4.0 SP4 does
not correctly read the installed network adapter's MediaType registry parameter.
Therefore, all DLC 802.2 connections appear as Ethernet connections because this
is the default connection type in SNA Server.

SNA Server 4.0 SP3 and SP4 display all DLC 802.2 connections as Ethernet
connections on Windows 2000 because the MediaType registry entry does not exist
in Windows 2000. Therefore, the default connection type of Ethernet is always
used when installing SNA Server 4.0 SP3 and SP4 on Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service
pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0 SP4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, use one of the following procedures, depending on
whether the SNA Server configuration includes connections with the incorrect
Ethernet icon:

 - If the SNA Server does not have any installed DLC 802.2 link services
   configured to use the Token Ring adapter and there are no connections that
   show the incorrect Ethernet icon, add new DLC 802.2 link services. New
   connections that use these newly added link services will show the correct
   Token Ring connection icon.

   -or-

 - If the SNA Server configuration has current connections with the wrong
   connection icon, follow these steps:

   a. Delete the DLC 802.2 link services (SnaDlc1) that the connections with the
      incorrect icon are using.

      NOTE: Removing the link services will cause any existing connections that
      were using it to show a link service of <None> when you view the
      connection's Properties in SNA Manager.

   b. Save the configuration.

   c. Add DLC 802.2 link services that point to the Token Ring adapter.

   d. Open the affected connections and select a DLC 802.2 link service that was
      just added in step c.

   e. Save the configuration.

   f. Close and re-open SNA Manager. The connections should now show the correct
      Token Ring icon.

Server DLC 802.2 connection type, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q140149 SNA 802.2 Connection Icon Indicates Incorrect Network Type

Because the MediaType registry parameter is not available in Windows 2000, the
DLC 802.2 link service was changed in Host Integration Server 2000 to query DLC
to determine the network adapter's media type. This change to query DLC was
included in this fix so that the correct media type is determined when you run
SNA Server 4.0 SP4 on Windows 2000 after the fix is applied.

If you install SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 on Windows NT 4.0, the
updated DLC 802.2 link service still reads the MediaType registry parameter to
determine the connection type.

The maximum Basic Transmission Unit (BTU) length for Ethernet connections
defaults to 1493, whereas the default for Token Ring connections is 1929. The
problem described here could result in some network connectivity issues because
of the difference in the default maximum BTU length.
