The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the fix from Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q275657, the
return address that is used after a password change becomes corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

If you choose to change the password, a pop-up window displays the "The password
is successfully changed" message, but the link to close this window is wrong.
For example, the link appears as

   http%3A//www.microsoft.com

instead of:

   http://www.microsoft.com

WORKAROUND
==========

The password change functionality is working correctly; the problem lies in the
return link. To work around this problem, click the Back button to return to the
calling page.

RESOLUTION
==========
