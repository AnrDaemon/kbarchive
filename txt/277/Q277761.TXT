TITLE   :Browser Must Reauthenticate When Browsing Between Partner Sites

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Passport, versions 1.3, 1.4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you go from one site to another for the first time, and both sites use
Passport authentication, you are asked to reauthenticate to the second site. You
must provide permission to provide information to the other site if you have not
been there at least once during the currently logged on session.

After the first time you provide logon information to the second site, you are
automatically signed in to the second site. However, the second site can perform
a "forced logon", so that you have to log on again to reauthenticate.

STATUS
======

This is by design.
