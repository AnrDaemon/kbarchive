TITLE   :BUG: ExitWindowsEx Function Fails to Shut Down the System
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6,4.0 SP6a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSUser

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6) or Windows NT 4.0 SP6a-based system,
when any application calls the ExitWindowsEx function, the system sends the
WM_QUERYENDSESSION message to all top-level windows. If any windows that receive
the message return FALSE, the shutdown process is stopped, irrespective of how
many windows return TRUE. Any subsequent calls to ExitWindowsEx fail to trigger
a reboot or a shutdown operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure your applications to call the InitiateSystemShutdownEx function to
reboot the system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
