======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

An unchecked buffer in the Terminal Server logon prompt could allow a malicious
user to cause the Terminal Server-based server to run arbitrary code. The
ability to run arbitrary code could allow the malicious user to add, change, or
delete data, run code already on the server, or upload new code to the server
and run it. The malicious user would not need to successfully log on to the
Terminal Server-based server to initiate this attack.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely if connection requests are not
filtered. By default, Terminal Server listens on TCP port 3389. You should block
this port at the firewall or router if Terminal Server access from the Internet
is not required.
