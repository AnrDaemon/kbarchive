OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the V3 Pro Antivirus software on Windows NT 4.0, there may be
a handle leak in a backup process (such as Ntbackup.exe or some third-party
backup software).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by the V3 Pro Antivirus software. Backup software
creates many event handles named \BaseNamedObjects\V3SOCKHOOK, but theV3 Pro
Antivirus software may not signal these events, so these handles leak.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of the V3 Pro Antivirus
software, Ahnlab (http://www.ahnlab.com) to obtain the latest update. Or, remove
the V3 Pro Antivirus software.
