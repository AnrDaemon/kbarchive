TITLE   :Queries on the Contents Property Do Not return Hits for MSG File
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2000,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Indexing Service 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you index .msg files by using Indexing Service and query the files by using
the contents property, you may not receive any hits in the result.

CAUSE
=====

MSG files are binary files, which are associated with the binary Null IFilter in
Indexing Service. The Null IFilter is not able to extract the textual
information out of the .msg file. As a result, you do not get any results if you
query the contents property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT Server 4.0, .msg files are processed by default with the Default
IFilter if the Filter Files with unknown extensions option is configured in
Index Server 2.0.

The Default IFilter extracts textual contents out of the .msg files. In this
case, you get .msg files in your query results.

For Indexing Service, Microsoft recommends that you write a custom IFilter for
.msg files. To do this, refer to the following section in the MSDN Library:

   Platform SDK\Base Services\Indexing Service\Using Custom Filters with
   Indexing Service
