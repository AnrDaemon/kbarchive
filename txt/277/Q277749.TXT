SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use MapPoint 2001 to find an address and set a
pushpin at that address.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find an address and set a pushpin at that address:

1. On a computer with MapPoint 2001 installed, create a new Visual Basic
   Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click References.

3. Click to select the Microsoft MapPoint Object Library 8.0 (North America)
   check box, and then click OK.

4. On Form1, add a Command button.

5. In the code window of Form1, paste the following code:

   Option Explicit

   Dim objApp As MapPoint.Application
   Dim objMap As MapPoint.Map
   Dim objLoc As MapPoint.Location
   Dim objPushpin as MapPoint.Pushpin

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   ' Automate MapPoint.
   ' Start MapPoint 2001.
   Set objApp = CreateObject("mappoint.application")
   ' Get the currently displayed map.
   Set objMap = objApp.ActiveMap
   ' Find an address.
   Set objLoc = objMap.FindAddress("One Microsoft Way", "Redmond", "Washington", "98052", geoCountryUnitedStates)
   ' Set a pushpin at the address.
   Set objPushpin = objMap.AddPushpin(objLoc, "Microsoft")
   ' Browse to the pushpin.
   objPushpin.GoTo
   ' Highlight the pushpin.
   objPushpin.Highlight = True
   ' Show MapPoint.
   objApp.Visible = True
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode As Integer)
   ' Clear the variables before you unload the form.
   Set objMap = Nothing
   Set objApp = Nothing
   Set objLoc = Nothing
   Set objPushpin = Nothing
   End Sub

6. Run the project.

7. Click Command1.

A pushpin in MapPoint marks the address you specified.
