TITLE   :Error Message When You Open a Notepad File on IBM AS400
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0,4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbfile kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open Notepad to view a file on an IBM AS400 server, you may receive the
following error message:

   "The specified server cannot perform the requested operation".

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the network redirector (Rdr.sys) incorporates
additional checks to validate data that is returned from a remote server for the
QueryInformationFile function. If less than the full structure size of data that
you expect (but a minimum structure size that is still valid) is returned from a
remote server, the client redirector returns the following error message to
Notepad:

   STATUS_INVALID_NETWORK_RESPONSE NTSTATUS 0xC00000C3
   "The network responded incorrectly".

Notepad maps this error to the following error:

   ERROR_BAD_NET_RESP WINERROR 0x57
   "The specified server cannot perform the requested operation".

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 SP7 that contains this fix.
