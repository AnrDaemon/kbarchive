======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Advertisement Status Viewer (Advertview.exe) tool to determine
the status of an advertisement on an individual Systems Management Server (SMS)
client or collection with a user-defined interval, the status of an
advertisement may be reported as "None." However, the SMS Administrator console
and direct queries against the SMS database may indicate that the status of the
advertisement is either "Success" or "Failure."

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the name of the computer for which you are checking the
status was entered in the database (the Name0 value in System_DISC) in lowercase
letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SMS service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
