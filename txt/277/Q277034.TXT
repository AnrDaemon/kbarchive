SUMMARY
=======

Some sound cards and laptop computers may not provide sufficient voltage to
power the microphone for the headset that is shipped with the Encarta Language
Learning programs listed at the beginning of this article.

Sound cards and laptop computers that do not supply sufficient voltage to the

the documentation for your sound card or laptop computer to determine whether
sufficient voltage is provided to power the Andrea Electronics model NC-110
microphone that is shipped with the Encarta Language Learning programs listed at
the beginning of this article.

The Andrea Electronics model NC-110 microphone that is shipped with the Encarta
Language Learning programs requires at least 1.25 volts to work properly.
