======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Linked Server is configured to DB2/400 from Microsoft SQL Server by using
the OLE DB provider for DB2, and a SELECT query is issued to retrieve data from
a DB2/400 table that contains a DBCS fixed-length character field, the following
error message may be returned:

   OLE DB provider 'DB2OLEDB' returned unexpected length of data from fixed
   length field <field name>

CAUSE
=====

The DB2 OLE DB Provider returns different values for the field length and the
actual data size, which causes the SELECT to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
