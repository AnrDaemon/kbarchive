TITLE   :Services Access Violation Because of Heap Damage
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv kberrmsg tslic_tslic kbWinNT400PreSP7Fixkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a server that hosts RPC server based programs, the Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) service may stop responding to requests, and you may receive the following
error message on the server console:

   Error 1723: The RPC server is too busy to complete this operation.

When you receive this error message, the server console may appear to stop
responding (hang), but the server responds to a TCP/IP ping. Also, network
connections that are created with the "net use" (without the quotation marks)
continue to function, but new connections may not succeed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a heap damage problem in Services.exe that results
in an access violation error message. The problem causes the RPC service to be
unable to dispatch work to RPC programs that are running on the server.

==========
