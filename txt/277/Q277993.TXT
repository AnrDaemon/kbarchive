TITLE   :FIX: ActualSize Property of the ADODB Recordset Returns -1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::2.6,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVBDB kbGrpDSMDAC kbDSupport kbOLEDB260bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The ActualSize property of the ADODB recordset returns -1 after calling the
Getchunk method to retrieve data.

This problem occurs only when you use the SQLOLEDB provider that ships with MDAC
2.6 with server-side cursors. This behavior does not occur if:

 - The CursorLocation property of the recordset is set to adUseClient.
 - MDAC version 2.5 or earlier is present.
 - A different data provider is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the cursor location of the Connection object to adUseClient.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version
2.7.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select References, and then set a Reference to Microsoft
   ActiveX Objects 2.6.

3. Paste the following code into the Form1 code window:

   Private Sub Form_Load()

   Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
   Dim rec As ADODB.Recordset

   Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
   'cn.CursorLocation = adUseClient
   cn.Open "Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sa;password=;Initial Catalog=pubs;Data Source=TestServer"

   Set rec = New ADODB.Recordset
   rec.Open "select * from pub_info", cn, adOpenKeyset, adLockBatchOptimistic, -1
   Dim varChunk As Variant
   MsgBox "Before " + Str(rec.Fields.Item("logo").ActualSize)
   varChunk = rec.Fields.Item("logo").GetChunk(rec.Fields.Item("logo").ActualSize)
   MsgBox "After  " + Str(rec.Fields.Item("logo").ActualSize)

   End Sub

4. Make the appropriate changes in the cn.Open statement to supply the required
   connection parameters to connect to SQL Server.

5. Run the project.
   Results: The second message box displays a "-1."

6. Stop the project, and uncomment the code line "cn.CursorLocation =
   adUseClient."

7. Restart the project.
   Results: The second message box is the same as the first, which is correct.
