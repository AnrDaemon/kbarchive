TITLE   :LU 6.2 Sessions Are Not Automatically Activated After Host IPL
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport sna4

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Independent LU 6.2 sessions on the SNA Server do not automatically become active
after a connection is taken down from the mainframe computer.

CAUSE
=====

The reason why the sessions are not retried in all cases (for example, in the
case of a sense code 087D/0001, which indicates a serious error in routing
between SSCPs), is that these types of problems require operator intervention
(do not recover by themselves).

The only sense codes that SNA Server retries the bind for are 0801, 0805, 0812,
0837, 0839, 0842, 0845, 084B, 0856, and 0857.

STATUS
======

The server is working as designed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an SNA Server is configured with auto activated LU 6.2 sessions, when the
connection to the partner LU is taken down on the mainframe computer (for
example, during scheduled maintenance), the SNA Server does not automatically
restart the LU 6.2 sessions. The PU comes back up on the mainframe computer, the
SNA connection goes active, but the LU 6.2 sessions do not autoactivate.

The following event may show up in the event logs:

   Description:

   APPC session deactivated abnormally

      Qualifier      = 0003

      Connection     = connection  

      LU alias       = lualias

      PLU alias      = plualias

      Mode name      = modename
     
      Session ID     = sessionid

      LFSID          = lfsid

      Client Domain  = clientdomain

      Client User    = clientuser

      Client Machine = clientmachine

   EXPLANATION
   0003  The session was deactivated because of a permanent (No retry) error,
   such as a parameter mismatch. Contact the administrator of the partner LU's 
   system to determine which parameters are mismatched.
