The information in this article applies to:

 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a program that uses Microsoft DirectX 8.0, you may experience the
following symptoms:

 - Your screen may flicker.

 - Programs that are running on your computer may briefly stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because DirectDraw tests the capabilities of your video
adapter the first time that you start a program that uses DirectX 8.0 on your
computer.

The symptoms occur while DirectDraw tests different display modes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DirectX 8.0 cycles through several display modes to test the capabilities of
your video adapter. The results of the video tests are written to the following
file:

   D3d8caps.dat

If you delete the D3d8caps.dat file or change the configuration of your video
adapter, the same symptoms occur the next time that you start a program that
uses DirectX 8.0.

NOTE: These symptoms also occur if you test DirectDraw by using the DirectX
Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe).
