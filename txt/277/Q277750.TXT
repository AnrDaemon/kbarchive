SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Visual Basic OLE control to find an
address and set a pushpin for that address in MapPoint 2001.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. On a computer with MapPoint 2001 installed, create a new Visual Basic
   Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click References.

3. Click to select the Microsoft MapPoint Object Library 8.0 (North America)
   check box, and then click OK.

4. Add a Command button to Form1.

5. Add an OLE control to Form1.

6. When the Insert Object dialog box appears, click Microsoft MapPoint North
   America.

7. In the code window of Form1, paste the following code:

   Dim objApp As MapPoint.Application
   Dim objMap As MapPoint.Map
   Dim objLoc As MapPoint.Location
   Dim objPushpin as MapPoint.Pushpin

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   ' Map a point in the OLE control.
   ' Get the application object from the OLE control.
   Set objApp = OLE1.object.Application
   ' Put the OLE control in Edit mode.
   OLE1.DoVerb (1)
   ' Get the current map.
   Set objMap = objApp.ActiveMap
   ' Find an address.
   Set objLoc = objMap.FindAddress("One Microsoft Way", "Redmond", "Washington", "98052", geoCountryUnitedStates)
   ' Set a pushpin at the address.
   Set objPushpin = objMap.AddPushpin(objLoc, "Microsoft")
   ' Browse to the pushpin.
   objPushpin.GoTo
   ' Highlight the pushpin.
   objPushpin.Highlight = True
   ' Set the focus back to the command button.
   ' Take OLE control out of Edit mode.
   Command1.SetFocus
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode As Integer)
   ' Clear variables before you unload the form.
   Set objMap = Nothing
   Set objApp = Nothing
   Set objLoc = Nothing
   Set objPushpin = Nothing
   End Sub

8. Run the project.

9. Click Command1.

A pushpin in MapPoint marks the address you specified.
