======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows 2000-based server that is running a Systems Management Server (SMS)
site may show multiple Mmc.exe tasks in Task Manager. These tasks:

 - use memory.

 - consume no CPU time.

 - do not quit.

 - do not appear on the desktop or task bar.

 - may be deleted manually from Task Manager.

Over time, on an unattended SMS site server, these tasks may build up to the
point of taking up all of the available memory.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Site Backup service starts two Mmc.exe processes each time that you
perform a site backup on a Windows 2000-based server. This occurs because of the
following command line in the Machinfo.bat file:

   winmsd.exe \\%1 /A /F

The command-line syntax for Winmsd on computers that are running Windows 2000
differs from the command-line syntax on computers that are running Windows NT
4.0. Because the Windows 2000-based Winmsd.exe does not interpret the
command-line parameters from the Machinfo.bat file (which are for the Windows NT
4.0-based Winmsd.exe), the Windows 2000-based Winmsd.exe ignores them, which
leaves the two Mmc.exe processes started and running.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior:

1. Quit the SMS Backup service.

2. Edit the Machinfo.bat file that is located in the SMS\Bin\i386 folder on the
   site server.

3. Find the command line

   winmsd.exe \\%1 /A /F

   and replace it with the following command line:

   winmsd.exe \\%1 /report %2\%3

4. Save the Machinfo.bat file.

NOTE: Make sure that you do not schedule to start the SMS backup task while you
are editing the Machinfo.bat file to change this command line.

NOTE: If you notice that multiple mmc tasks are left over on Win2000 Servers
running SMS built-in backups, and, after implementing the above steps
encountered more msinfo32 tasks in task manager, then implement the following
steps:

 - Confirm that all support files are present in the \sms\bin\i386\ folder for
   this task, including: Msinfo32.exe, Now.exe, Srvinfo.exe, and Tlist.exe.

 - Modify sms\bin\i386\machinfo.bat to call msinfo32 directly instead of winmsd.
   Change the line containing:

   WINMSD.EXE \\%1 /report %2\%3

   to

   MSINFO32.EXE \\%1 /report %2\%3

 - Confirm successful backup in smsbkup.log file. Run command line

   MACHINFO.BAT MCFR1D33 e:\sms backup\MCS\SiteServer\SMSbkSiteConfigNT (exit
   status 0).

   08/23/01 01:53:55 - backup completed.
   |SMS_SITE_BACKUP |8/23/2001 1:53:55 AM |1180 (0x049C)

   SMS site backup service is stopping.
   |SMS_SITE_BACKUP |8/23/2001 1:53:55 AM |1180 (0x049C)

 - Check the task list for mmc or msinfo32 tasks. There should be no tasks
   remaining.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you update the site to Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later, the service pack may
replace the updated Machinfo.bat file with a default file.

After you upgrade the site to SP3, check the Machinfo.bat file for the Winmsd
command line and modify it by following the steps in the "Workaround" section in
this article.
