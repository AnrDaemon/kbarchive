SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the status message 10002, which you can receive when you
distribute software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you distribute software with Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0,
you may receive a status message 10002 from a client. This status message
indicates that the client is aware of the advertisement and that the
advertisement can be run from the Advertised Programs tool in Control Panel.
Even though a status message 10002 indicates that the advertisement has been
received, the client may not automatically run the program for a variety of
reasons, such as:

 - The program is configured to run when a user is not logged on, the
   advertisement is not assigned, and a user is presently logged on.

 - The program is configured to run whether a user is logged on or not, the
   advertisement is not assigned, and a user is presently logged on.

The client can report the status message 10002 that signifies that the client has
seen and recorded the advertisement, but the client cannot return any further
status messages until some other action occurs, for example, an advertisement is
run on the computer by a user.

In Control Panel, you must double-click Advertised Programs for an unassigned
program to run. If the advertisement is made during a time when a user is not
logged on, the necessary user interaction cannot be made and the program cannot
run.

For a program to have the ability to run when a user is not logged on, you must
assign the program a mandatory time to run in the advertisement properties. When
you create a mandatory assignment, the client runs the command line of the
program, regardless of the logged on state of the computer.

To create an assignment schedule for an existing advertisement, right-click the
advertisement, and then click Properties. On the Schedule tab, click Create,
which is located above the Mandatory Assignments dialog box. You can assign the
advertisement if you specify a mandatory date or time for the program to run or
if you want the advertisement to run immediately after one of the following
events:

 - As soon as possible

 - Logon

 - Logoff

One or more additional status messages may be generated on the client as a result
of running an advertisement.
