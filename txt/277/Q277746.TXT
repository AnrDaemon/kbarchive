SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2, the air-to-ground mission
category may not be available.

CAUSE
=====

The air-to-ground mission category is available only if you build your own
air-to-ground mission with Mission Builder, which is included with Combat Flight
Simulator 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To start Mission Builder, follow these steps:

1. Quit Combat Flight Simulator 2 if it is running.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Combat
   Flight Simulator 2, and then click Mission Builder.

NOTE: Microsoft does not provide technical support for Combat Flight Simulator 2
Mission Builder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All of the single missions that are included with Combat Flight Simulator 2 are
"ace missions" that are based on the actual battles during which ace pilots
earned their distinguished standing.

A pilot becomes an ace by shooting down another aircraft; this is called an
air-to-air victory.
