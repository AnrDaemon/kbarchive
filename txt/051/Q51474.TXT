SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft C, there are some functions in the run-time library that take
character values as parameters (for example, memccpy, memset, and so on) and
that are prototyped as taking integers. This is not a documentation error and
your program will work correctly if a character value is passed in the place of
the integer parameter (automatic type conversion takes care of this).

The integer value is specified because when the compiler pushes parameters on the
stack so that the function being called can use them, it always pushes them in
integer sized increments. In a 16-bit program where an integer is 2 bytes, 2
bytes will be pushed on the stack regardless of whether the value is an integer
or a character. In a 32-bit program where an integer is always 4 bytes, 4 bytes
will be pushed on the stack regardless of whether the value is an integer, long,
short, or character.

Therefore, to simplify, the function is prototyped as receiving an integer.
