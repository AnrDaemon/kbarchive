SUMMARY
=======

The following FC (FILECOMPARE) command should compare file1 to file2, ignoring
white space and adding line numbers to the differences report:

   fc /w/n file1 file2

Blank lines should be counted when computing the reported line numbers; however,
they are not counted.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 4.x and 5.x. This
problem was corrected in later versions of MS-DOS.

Additional query words: 4.01 5.00
