SUMMARY
=======

For an application to use the printer most effectively, sometimes it is
necessary for the user to modify the printer settings. To accomplish this, an
application can activate the settings dialog box for the printer driver of the
currently selected printer.

DEVMODE demonstrates how this may be done. Three steps are required:

1. Load the printer driver.

2. Get the procedure address of the "DEVICEMODE" procedure exported by the
   driver.

3. Call the procedure through the procedure address.

The settings dialog box is responsible for obtaining any information from the
user and for saving any changes in the appropriate ini file.

Chapter 17 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit Guide to
Programming" provides additional information on this procedure.
