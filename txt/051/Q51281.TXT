SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, the standard Inquiry message type does not have the options
to send the message as Urgent or with a Return Receipt.

However, the form can be modified with the Form Designer to include these
options.

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
