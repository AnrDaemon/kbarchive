SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has available three software development kits (SDKs) for Microsoft
Mail for AppleTalk Networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a description of each SDK:

Gateways SDK
------------

The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for Gateways provides a comprehensive
set of tools for building gateways between AppleTalk Mail and other mail
systems. A well-defined set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allows
developers to tightly integrate the gateways with Microsoft Mail in order to
have the same high level of performance, transparency, and reliability as
AppleTalk Mail.

NOTE: This SDK comes as a set of C and Pascal libraries that can be used with the
Macintosh Programmers Workshop.

Applications SDK
----------------

The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for Applications allows application
vendors to tightly integrate their existing applications with AppleTalk Mail so
users can send and receive messages and fully formatted files from within these
applications. In addition, the Applications SDK lets an application use
Microsoft Mail as a mechanism for interapplication communication, allowing
developers to build powerful, distributed applications that can automatically
consolidate, distribute, and manipulate information across a network.

NOTE: This SDK comes as a set of C libraries that can be used with the Macintosh
Programmers Workshop.

SDK for HyperCard
-----------------

The Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit for HyperCard provides a set of
HyperCard extensions that allow AppleTalk Mail to be accessed from within
HyperCard. As a result, HyperCard developers can build powerful applications
that use Microsoft Mail to exchange information both between users and between
applications.

NOTE: This SDK is included with the Mail version 3.00 server on the Extras disk.
