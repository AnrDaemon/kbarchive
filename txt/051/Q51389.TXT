SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail, if you click the Form Mover button (after opening up a sample
form) and the Form Designer is not present on your machine, the following
message will appear:

   Can't Understand Arguments to Command Put.

This message appears if you click Cancel in response to the dialog box that pops
up asking you to locate the Form Designer. Clicking Cancel again (the only
option) causes a blank Form Designer screen to appear. Installing the Forms
Designer and starting the process over will alleviate this problem.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
