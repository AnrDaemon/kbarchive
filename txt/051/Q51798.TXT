The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive a "file not found" error over a Novell network when the file
referenced is on a network drive. This message occurs even if the file is
included in the search mappings or specified using a fully qualified path.

CAUSE
=====

The error message is caused because the requested file has not been properly
closed by the network software. Thus, according to the network and to MS-DOS,
the file is still open and being accessed.

To confirm that open files are causing this problem, you must have supervisor
capabilities. Running the NetWare utility FCONSOLE with supervisor capabilities
allows you to observe the file attributes. The file will be marked as open.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rebooting the workstation or logging out may not correct the problem. However,
rebooting the server usually closes the file and solves the problem. Novell has
no utility to manually close a file, so you must wait for the internal processes
to time out and close the file. The length for time out has not been determined,
but can be up to 15 or 20 minutes.

================
