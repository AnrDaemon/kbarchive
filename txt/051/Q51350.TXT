The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.00 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.00b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.00b, both of which are located in the System Folder of
the Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661, but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


Gateway recipients are external mail accounts with which Microsoft Mail users
communicate frequently. These account names are added to the Microsoft Mail
directory list of the gateway server and any gateway-access servers created from
it. However, these names do not propagate to any other servers on the network.
Since only the server on which the recipients reside (and any gateway-access
servers created from it) can have privileges to send to these users, these names
don't need to be propagated to all servers in the network.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
