The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Missing or misaligned characters in menus or dialog boxes of Windows
applications running under Windows 3.1 can be caused by a modified
[FontSubstitutes] section in the WIN.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Windows application looks for Helv as its font in dialog boxes and that
font does not exist, the application refers to the [FontSubstitutes] section in
the WIN.INI file. Normally, MS Sans Serif is substituted for Helv. However, if
this section has been modified to read Helv=Arial instead of Helv=MS Sans Serif,
missing or misaligned characters may occur.

The [FontSubstitutes] section should read as follows:

   [FontSubstitutes]
   Helv=MS Sans Serif
   Tms Rmn=MS Serif
   Times=Times New Roman
   Helvetica=Arial

If the [FontSubstitutes] section is correct as described above, check to see if
MS San Serif has been installed in Windows 3.1. If it has not been installed,
the same missing character and misalignment problems occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
