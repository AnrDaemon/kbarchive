SUMMARY
=======

If you are running version 1.0 of Microcom's Carbon Copy for Windows with
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you need to obtain the 1.0b upgrade patch to
avoid Setup problems and to use all of the features of Windows 3.1, such as new
video and sound drivers. This patch is available from Microcom Technical
Support.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microcom's Carbon Copy for Windows is installed, Setup may fail when you
upgrade from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1 because of modifications made to several
entries in the SYSTEM.INI file.

This problem does not occur with the version 1.0b patch.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, rename the SYSTEM.INI file to SYSTEM.XXX by
   typing the following:

   REN SYSTEM.INI SYSTEM.XXX

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, rename the SYSTEM.CCW file to SYSTEM.INI by
   typing the following:

   REN SYSTEM.CCW SYSTEM.INI

3. Install Windows.

4. Reinstall Carbon Copy for Windows.

This problem does not occur with the version 1.0b patch.

Carbon Copy for Windows is manufactured by Microcom, a vendor independent of
