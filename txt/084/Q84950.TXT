The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows File Manager cannot connect from a LAN Manager 2.0 or 2.1
MS-DOS workstation to a network share name that is greater than the standard
MS-DOS limit of eight characters followed by a period (.) and a three letter
extension. For example, you can connect to:

   \\SERVER\SHARNAME.EXT

You cannot connect to:

   \\SERVER\SHARNAMEX.EXT

Both of the above shares will be viewable through File Manager's Browse ability.
When attempting to connect to a share with a long name, the following error
messages are displayed:

   LAN Manager 2.0:  Invalid Network Name

   LAN Manager 2.1:  This Network Name Cannot be Found

The network server name does not have this limitation. For example, you can
connect to:

   \\SERVERNAME\SHARNAME.EXT

MORE INFORMATION
================

From a LAN Manager 2.0 enhanced MS-DOS workstation, if you have two shares, one
named \\SERVER\SHARENAME (invalid) and the other named \\SERVER\SHARENAM
(valid), and you use File Manager's Browse function and attempt to connect to
\\SERVER\SHARENAME (invalid), then you will be connected to \\SERVER\SHARENAM
(valid).
