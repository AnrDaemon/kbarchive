SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1 includes run- time
libraries and header files compatible with version 6.0 of the Microsoft C
Compiler. These files are on a separate floppy disk, which contains its own
installation program.

These files are required only to develop applications for Windows 3.1 using
Microsoft C version 6.0. Many other development environments, including
Microsoft QuickC for Windows and Microsoft C version 7.0, provide their own
appropriate run-time libraries and header files.

To install the run-time libraries and header files, run the INSTALL.BAT batch
file on the "Microsoft C 6.0 Run-time Libraries" disk.

For more information on the C run-time libraries provided with the Windows SDK
version 3.1, see page 3 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit:
Getting Started" manual.

For more information on installing the Windows SDK version 3.1, including an
article that provides the recommended installation procedure, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " windows and sdk and setupinst " (without the quotation marks)
