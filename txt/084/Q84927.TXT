-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If the Print TrueType As Graphics check box in Control Panel printer setup is
grayed, check the printer driver's Graphics Resolution setting. Some Microsoft
Windows version 3.1 printer drivers allow Print TrueType As Graphics to be
enabled only at certain resolutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4 printer driver, you have to set the
Graphics Mode of the driver to RASTER (instead of HP-GL/2)to enable the Print
Truetype as Graphics box.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

If a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IID Windows 3.1 driver is installed, do the
following to reproduce the problem:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. From the list of printers, select HP LaserJet IID On LPTx.

4. Choose the Setup button.

Adjusting the Graphics Resolution setting and choosing the Options button will
exhibit the enabling and disabling of the Print TrueType As Graphics check box.
When the Resolution is set to 300 dots per inch (dpi), Print TrueType As
Graphics can be enabled. The 75 and 150 dpi resolutions disable this check box
and cause it to be grayed.
