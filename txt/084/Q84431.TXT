TITLE   :Sounds Option Unavailable in Alarm Clock
PRODUCT :Miscellaneous Windows Products
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Sounds option under the Settings menu in the Alarm Clock program is
unavailable (dimmed). Alarm Clock is located in the Accessories group and comes
with Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0.

CAUSE
=====

If the file WINCOM.DLL is not in the path, is missing, or is corrupted, the
Sounds option is unavailable.

The WINCOM.DLL file is necessary for playing .WAV sound files through the Sounds
option. The WINCOM.DLL file should have a size of 38800 bytes with a date of
8/14/91 and is normally located in the Windows\SYSTEM directory. The size and
date were taken from the WINCOM.DLL file included with the "generic" version of
Multimedia Extensions 1.0 and does not reflect any changes made by other
vendors.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Perform one of the following:

1. Move the WINCOM.DLL to a directory that is not in the path.

   -or-

2. Delete the WINCOM.DLL file.

   -or-

3. Corrupt the WINCOM.DLL file by typing the following commands at the MS-DOS
   command prompt

   copy /b <filename>+wincom.dll wincom.dl

   rename wincom.dl wincom.dll

   where <filename> is the name of a file. For example:

   copy /b config.sys+wincom.dll wincom.dl

   The Copy command combines the source <filename> with the WINCOM.DLL
   file, thus creating a corrupt file called WINCOM.DL. Use the Rename command
   to rename the WINCOM.DL to WINCOM.DLL.

Each of these methods results in an unavailable (dimmed) Sounds option in Alarm
Clock.
