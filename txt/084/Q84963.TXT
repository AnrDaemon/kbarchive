======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When dBASE IV is run in a window under Microsoft Windows 3.1, the text in cells
may not be displayed in reverse video if the VGA with Monochrome display driver
that comes with Windows 3.1 is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use Windows Setup to install the standard VGA 16-color
video driver. In most cases, this corrects the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The VGA with Monochrome display driver provides only four shades of gray for
MS-DOS-based applications in a window. The standard VGA 16-color display driver
provides 16 shades of gray for MS-DOS-based applications running in a window.

If dBASE IV is running full screen under Windows, it correctly reverses the video
for text in cells.

DBASE IV is manufactured by Ashton-Tate, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
