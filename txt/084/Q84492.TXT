-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 maintenance mode of Setup may
give the following error if it is executed from MS-DOS on a network workstation
that contains a WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory:

   Setup is unable to copy the file F:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\EGA.3GR. This file already
   exists in the destination directory and is marked as read-only.

   You must remove the read-only attributes from all the files in your Windows
   directory in order to successfully complete Windows setup.

In the above error message, F:\WINDOWS is the network shared directory that
contains the expanded Windows 3.1 files. The driver EGA.3GR is provided here as
an example.

Running Setup from inside Windows 3.1 will not cause this error message.

CAUSE
=====

Attempting to change a Windows setting by running Setup from MS-DOS on a network
workstation can cause a file copy error if there is a SYSTEM directory located
in the workstation's WINDOWS directory.

Network workstations should not have a SYSTEM subdirectory located on either the
local or network WINDOWS directory. Having a SYSTEM directory may confuse
applications and cause errors.

There are three ways to correct this error:

1. Rename the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory on the workstation.

   -or-

2. Delete the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory on the workstation.

   -or-

3. Run the maintenance mode of Setup from the Windows Main group by selecting
   the Windows Setup icon.
