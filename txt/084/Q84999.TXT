SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 may not print TrueType fonts in reverse video
(white on black background) unless they are printed as graphics.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows may only print a TrueType font in reverse video if the TrueType font is
printed as a graphic.

To print TrueType fonts as graphics:

1. Select the Printers icon in the Control Panel.

2. Choose the Setup button for the appropriate printer.

3. Choose the Options button.

4. Select the Print TrueType as Graphics box.

For Postscript printers:

1. Select the Printers icon in the Control Panel.

2. Choose the Setup button for the appropriate printer.

3. Choose the Options button.

4. Choose the Advanced button.

5. In the "Send to Printer as: box, select Bitmap (Type3).

Printing TrueType fonts as graphics reduces the printing speed, so only use this
method when a reverse video print option from an application is needed.
