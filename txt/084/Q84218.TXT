The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use Windows' File Manager to format a floppy system disk on a computer
that originally had IBM DOS installed and was upgraded to MS-DOS 5.0 or 6.0, the
correct MS-DOS COMMAND.COM is copied over, and the incorrect IBMBIO.COM and
IBMDOS.COM files may be copied to the system disk instead of the MS-DOS 5.0 or
6.0 files MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two workarounds to this problem:

 - Remove the two hidden IBM files from the root directory of the hard drive.


 - Format the system disks outside of Windows. The MS-DOS SYS.COM does not get
   confused by the hidden files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an IBM DOS system is upgraded to MS-DOS 5.0, the IBM hidden files are left
on the hard drive because it is difficult to know if these files belong to IBM
DOS or IBM OS/2. The IBM OS/2 files take up too much space to be copied to the
MS-DOS 5.0 uninstall disk.
