The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The second screen displayed by the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)
version 3.1 installation program includes the following statement:

   NOTE: The Windows SDK no longer provides C run-time libraries for Windows
   development. These files are provided by the C compiler vendor with their
   Windows development environment.

This statement is incorrect. The Windows SDK version 3.1 includes a disk of
run-time libraries and header files for use with the Microsoft C Optimizing
Compiler version 6.0. However, the SDK installation program does not install
these libraries and header files. The libraries disk has its own installation
batch file.

For more information on the C run-time libraries provided with the Windows SDK
version 3.1, see page 3 of the "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit:
Getting Started" manual.

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
