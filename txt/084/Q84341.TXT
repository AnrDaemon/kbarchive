The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Windows version 3.1 with an IBM Quietwriter III with the
IBM cartridge #1318010 selected, the wrong fonts display in Windows- based
applications. If you choose and print one of these incorrect fonts, the printer
displays the following error message:

   Font Error

CAUSE
=====

The font cartridge #1318010 should have the following fonts: Artisan, Letter
Gothic 12 CPI, Gothic 17 CPI, and Title PS. However, when the above cartridge is
chosen in Windows 3.1, the fonts that are listed in Windows-based applications
(including Write) are: Boldface Italic PS, Courier Italic 12 CPI, Modern PS,
Prestige Elite 12 CPI.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Windows version 3.1
Quietwriter printer driver. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.
