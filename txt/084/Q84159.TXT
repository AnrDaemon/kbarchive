The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Mouse trails makes it easier for you to track the mouse pointer on an LCD
display. Although they are intended for LCD displays, mouse trails can be used
with other display types as well.

NOTE: Mouse trails functionality is supplied by the video driver, not the mouse
driver.

Mouse trails are supported by the Windows version 3.1 EGA, VGA, and Super VGA
(800 x 600, 16 colors) drivers.

The following two Windows mouse drivers support mouse trails and are shipped with
Windows 3.1.

Manufacturer        Driver Name    Version
------------        -----------     -------
Microsoft Mouse     MOUSE.DRV        8.20
Microsoft Mouse    MOUSE.DRV        9.00
Logitech Mouse      LMOUSE.DRV       6.02

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mouse trails are not supported under VGA with Monochrome display, which is
provided with Windows 3.1, and mouse trails may not be supported by third- party
video and/or mouse drivers.

Mouse trails are not supported by the CGA video driver because Windows 3.1 does
not fully support CGA, and uses the Windows 3.0 CGA video driver. Mouse trails
are rarely supported by very high-resolution video drivers because these driver
are rarely used on laptop computers. Currently, mouse trail support is NOT
provided for XOR-only cursors, such as the I-beam and the cross-hair cursor used
by Paintbrush.

If your third-party video driver or your Windows mouse driver does not support
mouse trails, contact your hardware manufacturer regarding the company's support
for mouse trails.
