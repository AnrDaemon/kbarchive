SUMMARY
=======

When using a 3COM 3C501 network card on a Novell network with Windows version
3.1, you may receive the following error if you used 3COM low-level drivers
earlier than version 2.5 during the WSGEN process:

   System Error: Cannot read from device Network

To correct this problem contact your 3COM dealer and obtain updated low-level
drivers (version 2.5 or later), and then generate a new IPX.COM file. With the
new low-level drivers, IPX is still version 3.1.

Note: These cards cannot be used as a Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) server. They
can be used with Windows for Workgroups as a client only.

For more information on Windows for Workgroups, query on "WFWG" in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base.
