SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Productivity Pack version 3.1 is designed to prevent screen savers
from activating so that they don't distract the user from the tutorial. There
are places in the tutorial where the user may read for several minutes, and
would not want a screen saver to suddenly appear.

The Productivity Pack, however, can only prevent screen savers from interrupting
if the screen savers use Windows 3.1 function calls that can be trapped. For
example, the Productivity Pack can trap the screen saver built into Windows 3.1
and prevent it from blanking the screen. Other screen savers such as Idlewild,
included in the Entertainment Pack, cannot be trapped and are free to interrupt
the application.

If the application is interrupted by a screen saver, it is reduced to an icon at
the base of the screen. At this point, you can double-click the application
icon, or choose Restore from the Control menu to continue.
