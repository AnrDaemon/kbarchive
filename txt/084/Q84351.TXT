SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Resource Kit version 3.1 adds the Info command to the menu bar in
the Windows operating system version 3.1 File Manager. Other applications may
also add additional options to the File Manager through the [AddOns] section of
WINFILE.INI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Info is chosen in File Manager, there are three options:

1. Show File Size Information: This option displays the total file size for
   selected files and subdirectories. For example, selecting a directory in File
   Manager, choosing Info, then selecting Show File Size Information shows
   information similar to the following:

   The specified selection contains...

   Number of Files: 170
   Number of directories: 3
   Total File Size: 6,672 bytes

2. Display Bytes As KB: This option displays in kilobytes the total file size
   displayed in the Show File Size Information option. The file size is
   displayed in kilobytes instead of bytes, as in the above example.

3. About File Size Information: This option gives limited information about the
   utility.

When the Windows Resource Kit is installed, the following changes are made to the
[AddOns] section of the WINFILE.INI file to allow the Info command to be
available in File Manager:

      [AddOns]
      File Size Extension=C:\WINDOWS\FILESIZE.DLL
