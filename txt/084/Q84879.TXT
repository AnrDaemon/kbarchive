======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the NEC Silentwriter 95 printer driver for Microsoft Windows
from the disks provided by NEC or from the files downloaded from the NEC
Technologies bulletin board (BBS), the driver may not be accessible when you
choose the Printers icon in the Windows Control Panel. Instead, when you select
the NEC Silentwriter 95 and choose the Setup button, the Apple Laserwriter
printer driver appears.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to an error in the OEMSETUP.INF file provided with the NEC
drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

NEC has corrected this problem. You can obtain updated printer driver files from
NEC. Ask for the "Windows 3.1 Printers Support Disk."

Alternatively, you can resolve the error in the OEMSETUP.INF file. The following
information, obtained from the NEC Technologies BBS, describes how to correct
the problem:

1. Run Notepad.

2. Insert your original PostScript Printer Support Kit disk into drive A (or B).

3. From the Notepad File menu, choose Open.

4. Type the filename

   " A:\\OEMSETUP.INF" (without the quotation marks)

   (type B instead of A if you are using drive B) and choose the OK button. The
   file will appear in Notepad.

5. Look for the line with "Silentwriter 95" and add the version "v2010.121"
   (without the quotation marks) to the end of the printer's name. For example,
   Silentwriter 95 should now read:

   Silentwriter 95 v2010.121

6. Save the file and quit Notepad.

7. Run Control Panel and install the printer using the original instructions
   within the PostScript Printer Support Kit.

After installation, the correct printer dialog box appears when you select the
Silentwriter 95.
