You can configure your system to use the Compaticard by following these steps:

1. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file using a standard ASCII text editor such as Windows
   Notepad.

2. Modify the SMARTDRV.EXE line to disable the floppy cache. For example, enter

         c:\windows\smartdrv.exe a- b- XXXX YYYY

   where "xxxx" refers to the SMARTDrive cache size at the MS-DOS level (before
   Windows starts). "yyyy" refers to the size of the cache after Windows starts.
