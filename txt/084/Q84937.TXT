======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Windows version 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode with the 32-bit disk access
feature enabled, the following error message may appear:

   The Microsoft Windows 32-bit disk driver (WDCTRL) will not be loaded because
   WDCTRLDISABLE=Y is set in this machine's environment. Remove this environment
   string and the 32-bit disk driver will load normally.

   To continue starting Windows without using the 32-bit disk driver, press any
   key.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when there is an environment variable called
WDCTRLDISABLE being set at the MS-DOS level before Windows is started.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the MS-DOS SET command to check for the existence
of WDCTRLDISABLE, and if it exists, type the following at the MS-DOS command
prompt to clear it:

   SET WDCTRLDISABLE=

If necessary, edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor such as Notepad or the
MS-DOS Editor to remove the WDCTRLDISABLE=Y setting.
