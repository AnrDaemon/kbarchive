The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first time you run Windows Setup to install third-party device drivers,
Setup will copy the file OEMSETUP.INF to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory as
OEM?.INF (where ? is the lowest number 0-9 not yet used). The next time you
run Setup to install or change the third-party display drivers that are
listed in the OEM?.INF file, Setup will ask for a disk with the Windows 3.1
logo file in drive A. If you are installing third-party display drivers
from a drive other than drive A, Windows 3.1 Setup will still ask for the
Windows 3.1 logo file in drive A, even if there is no drive A in the
system.

The same thing will occur if you select a display driver already installed
and choose the option to overwrite the existing driver set with new files.

If you are installing third-party display drivers from a drive other than
drive A, and are prompted for the Windows 3.1 logo file in drive A, press
ESC twice and type the path to the Windows 3.1 logo file.
