SUMMARY
=======

Pages 274 and 275 of the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit discuss how to set up
shared program groups with Microsoft Windows 3.1. Step 2 on page 275 says that
the group files (.GRP) must be marked read-only. However, doing so may produce
the following error if you change the Windows video display driver on a
workstation:

   Group File Error: Program group file <filename> is write protected.
   Its icons cannot be updated for the new display device.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The .GRP files contain icon display information. If the video display driver is
changed, the group icon information is also changed.

After the errors for each group are displayed, the icons may appear visually
correct. However, after some usage in Windows, the icons may become blotchy or
incorrectly displayed.

To avoid this problem, create separate directories containing display-specific
groups for different display drivers. The PROGMAN.INI file for each workstation
should point to the correct directory containing the display-specific groups.
