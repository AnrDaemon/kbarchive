MORE INFORMATION
================

To disable access to a specific tool in Control Panel, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Control.ini file in the
   Windows folder.

2. Search the file for a [don't load] section. If this section does not exist,
   add it.

3. Add the following line to the [don't load] section for each tool you want to
   disable

   <icon>=no

   where <icon> is the Control Panel tool you want to disable.

   For Windows and Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11, use the name of
   the tool as it appears in Control Panel. For example, to disable the Printers
   tool in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, add the following line to the [don't
   load] section:

   Printers=no

   For Windows 95, use the name of the .cpl file associated with the tool you
   want to disable. The Windows 95 .cpl files are listed in the table below. For
   example, to disable the System tool in Windows 95, add the following line to
   the [don't load] section:

   sysdm.cpl=no

4. Save the Control.ini file and then quit the editor.

5. Restart the computer.
