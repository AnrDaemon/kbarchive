The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Artisoft Sounding Board installation program may detect the PC-Speaker
driver and generate the following error message:

   Install cannot run while the Sounding Board driver is loaded. Remove the
   driver and restart Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error message, do the following:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Drivers icon.

3. Select Sound Driver For PC-Speaker, and choose the Remove button.

4. Choose the OK button.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PC-Speaker driver can be reinstalled after the Sounding board software has
been successfully installed; however, .WAV files will play through the Sounding
Board, not through the PC-Speaker driver.

Artisoft manufactures the Sounding Board, which is designed to allow users to
communicate on a LANtastic network through voice mail. The board also allows
machines not running LANtastic to record voice messages in several audio
formats, including the .WAV format supported by Windows 3.1.

The Sounding Board is manufactured by Artisoft, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
