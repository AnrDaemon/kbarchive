SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the procedures for turning off the MoreFonts soft font
package, manufactured by Micrologic Software, in Microsoft Windows operating
environment versions 3.0 or 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, MoreFonts is installed in the MF directory. Typeface files are
copied to the PCLFONTS directory. In addition, the MoreFonts version 3.0
installation copies four files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory and one file
to the WINDOWS directory.

Files copied to the WINDOWS directory:

 - MF.INI

Files copied to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory:

 - MFSYS.INI

 - MFTYPE.INI

 - WINWPS.DLL

 - GERONIMO.DLL

The Windows system files are modified as follows:

WIN.INI:

   No entries; no modifications

SYSTEM.INI:

         [BOOT]
         SYSTEM.DRV=MFSYS.DRV
         MF.SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

How to Turn off MoreFonts
-------------------------

Choose the MoreFonts icon in the Windows Program Manager, then choose the Options
button and choose the Off button.

How to Disable (Uninstall) MoreFonts
------------------------------------

In the Windows SYSTEM.INI file, comment out or delete the following lines in the
[BOOT] section:

      SYSTEM.DRV=MFSYS.DRV
      MF.SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

Add the following line to the [BOOT] section of the SYSTEM.INI:

   SYSTEM.DRV=SYSTEM.DRV

How to Reinstall MoreFonts for Windows
