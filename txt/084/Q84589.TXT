======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information has been reported by Phoenix Technologies. Microsoft
has not tested this and makes no warranty implied or otherwise as to the
validity of the following problem and/or workaround.

INFORMATION FROM PHOENIX TECHNOLOGIES
-------------------------------------

A problem has been reported when using certain versions of Phoenix BIOS and
loading the MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 version of EMM386.EXE.

CAUSE
=====

When pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL when using MS-DOS Prompt with the Windows 3.1 version
of EMM386.EXE loaded, the system hangs. This problem also occurs when using the
MS-DOS 5.0 version of EMM386.EXE with the RAM option, or if KEYB.COM is loaded
with MS-DOS 5.0 EMM386.EXE.

WORKAROUND
==========

This workaround should be used ONLY if the system displays the symptom described
above. In those instances tested, the following workaround has been verified to
resolve the problem. Edit the EMM386.EXE line in your CONFIG.SYS file to include
the following parameter:

   X=ffff-ffff

For example: Original:

   device=c:\windows\emm386.exe

Modified:

   device=c:\windows\emm386.exe x=ffff-ffff

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the modified EMM386.EXE statement is executed, the following message is
returned:

   WARNING: User specified range overlaps. Press any key to continue....

Aside from the inconvenience of the pause, which times out, allowing the computer
to continue executing the CONFIG.SYS file, no other side effects have been
observed.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 3rdparty boot reboot re-boot
