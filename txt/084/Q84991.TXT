======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Windows Write fails to correctly display the WingDings font on the screen when
certain printers that have a large number of device fonts, such as the Panasonic
KX-P 1124, are installed.

CAUSE
=====

Write tries to enumerate the entire set of fonts available to it (TrueType and
device fonts). If there are more than 50 TrueType and device fonts, Write fails
to correctly display the fonts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.


Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 true type
