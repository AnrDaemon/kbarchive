SUMMARY
=======

When the SPY utility provided with the Microsoft Windows Software Development
Kit (SDK) reports the module name for a running application, it reports the name
of the executable file. However, the module name and the name of the application
don't need to match. The module name of an application is specified in the NAME
statement in the application's module definition (DEF) file.

For example, SPY indicates that the module name for Microsoft Word for Windows is
WINWORD. However, calling GetModuleHandle("WINWORD") always returns zero even
when Word for Windows is running.

The EXEHDR utility, which is also provided with the Windows SDK, reports the
correct module name for an application. EXEHDR reports the module name for Word
for Windows as MSWORD. GetModuleHandle("MSWORD") returns the module handle for
Word for Windows if it is running.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.10
