======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you use a Xircom pocket Ethernet card with Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 on a Novell network, you may experience printing problems if an
outdated Xircom low-level driver was used during the WSGEN process. The latest
drivers are dated 4/92.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use one of the following workarounds:

 - Contact Xircom to obtain the IPX.COM file that Xircom has created with the
   updated low-level driver for your particular Xircom adapter, or download this
   file from the Xircom bulletin board service (BBS).

   -or-

 - Contact Xircom to obtain the necessary updated PxShell.OBJ for your
   particular Xircom adapter, or download this file from the Xircom BBS. Then,
   generate a new IPX.COM file using the PxSHELL.OBJ file and the Windows 3.1
   IPX.OBJ file. (The "x" in PxSHELL.OBJ varies depending on the card type.)

NOTE: With the new low-level drivers, IPX is still version 3.1.

Windows 3.0
-----------

The drivers for Windows 3.0 and 3.0a should be as follows:
