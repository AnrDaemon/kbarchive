Under a variety of circumstances an application might be designed to change the
predefined behavior of an MDI client window. Superclassing provides the easiest
and cleanest method to change window styles or to handle messages in a unique
manner.

By default, an MDI client window cannot accept mouse button double-clicks. If an
application superclasses the client window, the application can change the
window style of the client window and have it accept double- clicks. An
application can also use this method to change the MDI client window background
color.

The SuperMDI sample application demonstrates how to change the color of the MDI
client window and enable the MDI client to respond to mouse button
double-clicks.
