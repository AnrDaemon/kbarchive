-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you use the Media Player with the PC
Speaker driver installed:

   No wave device that can play files in the current format is installed. Use
   the Drivers option to install the wave device.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of a limitation with the PC Speaker. The only
workaround is to use a supported sound board.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Media Player will not work with the PC Speaker driver installed. The PC Speaker
driver will only work with applications that use the high level SndPlaySound DLL
routine (used in Sounds under Control Panel), or most low level wave routines
(used in Sound Recorder). The PC Speaker driver will not work with MCI command
strings, which the Media Player uses.
