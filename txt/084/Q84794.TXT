KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive one of the following error messages when you run Windows version
3.1:

   Cannot run DOS application in second instance of Windows

   -or-

   Cannot start non-windows application in second instance of Windows

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you have outdated Windows 3.0 system files in the
Windows \SYSTEM subdirectory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem locate and replace the outdated files.

Check the Windows \SYSTEM subdirectory for old .MOD files. The following files
could cause the above error message if they are dated earlier than 3-10-92:

   WINOLDAP.MOD
   WINOA386.MOD
   WINOA286.MOD

To correct this problem, expand the WINOLDAP.MOD file into the WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory, as follows:

   c:\windows\expand a:\winoldap.mo_ c:\windows\system\winoldap.mod

If you are running Windows 3.1 on a 386 or higher machine, you will also need to
expand WINOA386.MOD as follows:

   c:\windows\expand a:\winoa386.mo_ c:\windows\system\winoa386.mod

Windows 3.1 does not need WINOA286.MOD; it is a Windows 3.0 file.
