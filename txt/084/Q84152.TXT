SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 supports Linotype PostScript typesetters
differently than Windows version 3.0 does.

The list of specific models supported by Windows 3.1 differs from the list of
models supported by Windows 3.0, and the Extra paper size options are not
included in Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Windows 3.0, the Linotype 100, 300, and 500 models are supported by the
PostScript printer driver. Under Windows 3.1, these specific models are
supported by the 200/230, 330, and 530 drivers, respectively. However, problems
have been reported when the newer drivers are used with the Linotype 100, 300,
and 500.

Under Windows 3.0, the Linotype 100, 300, and 500 models support the Extra paper
sizes Letter-Extra, Legal-Extra, A4-Extra, and Tabloid-Extra. Under Windows 3.1,
these sizes are supported by the PostScript driver.
