SUMMARY
=======

Windows version 3.1 allows you to assign waveform audio sounds to certain events
through the Control Panel. These events are:

   Default Beep
   Exclamation
   Windows Start
   Windows Exit
   Critical Stop
   Question
   Asterisk

However, it is not possible to reliably assign these sounds to always occur at
given points in a program. For example, it is not possible to always have the
Exclamation sound occur when an error occurs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

System sounds are dependent upon the application in which they are occurring. To
produce a sound, an application needs to notify Windows that a sound is to
occur, and then tell Windows which system sound to play. The application will
specify one of the seven default system sounds, or any sound event that it has
added to this list.

This means that you cannot add sound events to the default list and have an
application play that sound, unless the application has been specifically
written to call that sound event.

Additionally, applications have not standardized on when these sound events
should occur. Therefore, one application may play the Default Beep sound when an
error occurs while another application might play the Critical Stop sound.
