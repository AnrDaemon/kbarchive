======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Setup does not expand MOUSE.COM or MOUSE.SYS into
the Windows directory unless MOUSE.SYS is loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file or
MOUSE.COM is loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To expand these files into the Windows directory, use one of the following
commands at the command prompt

   expand a:\mouse.co_ c:\windows\mouse.com

-or-

   expand a:\mouse.sy_ c:\windows\mouse.sys

where the files are located on the following disks:

   Filename     Filename           Disk Number          File Size
   (Expanded)   (Compressed)  1.44MB  1.2MB   720K   (Compd)  (Expnd)
   ----------   ------------  ------  -----   ----   -------  -------

   MOUSE.COM    MOUSE.CO_       4       4       A    31,328   56,408
   MOUSE.SYS    MOUSE.SY_       4       5       A    30,733   55,160

When installing the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, if the
Microsoft Mouse driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file (as in the example
below), it is possible that Setup will not detect the MS-DOS- level Microsoft
Mouse driver:

   install=mouse.com
