SUMMARY
=======

When running Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 on a Microsoft LAN
Manager 2.0 enhanced workstation and attempting to logon to the network through
Windows, you may receive the following error message:

   Unrecognized Network Error, Error Code 3

This error message is caused by a missing LANMAN.DOS\PROFILES directory. Windows
3.1's LANMAN.DRV driver checks this directory during the logon procedure.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create a LANMAN.DOS\PROFILES directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have LAN Manager 2.0 as your network and you have saved persistent
connections in the [Networks] section of your WIN.INI file, then when you start
Windows 3.1 before logging on to your network, you get prompted to log on.
Windows then tries to restore all saved connections. The error occurs because
the PROFILES subdirectory is missing.


LANMAN.DRV is the Windows 3.1 driver for LAN Manager 2.0 and is installed in the
[boot] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

      [boot]
      network.drv=lanman.drv
