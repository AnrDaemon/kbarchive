SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses information from the Symantec application note #4103
about Norton Utilities version 6.01 and Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. NCACHE, the Norton disk caching software, may cause system lockups when
   Windows 3.1 is run in standard mode. Norton recommends configuring NCACHE for
   extended memory. If the problem continues, then disable the Write cache.
   Consult your Norton manual for instructions.

2. NCACHE is not compatible with Windows 3.1's 32-Bit-Disk-Access. If using
   32-Bit-Disk-Access, then use SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0.

3. The following error message will occur if you run Norton's Calibrate utility
   while SMARTDRV.EXE is caching the drive:

   Disk Mapping Error

   Disable SMARTDRV.EXE when using the Calibrate program.

4. Microsoft recommends not running Norton Disk Monitor, DISKMON.EXE, while
   Windows is running. It may cause a prolonged beeping noise.

5. Erase Protect is normally configured to use as much free hard drive space as
   necessary, this will sometimes cause Windows to experience printing and
   temporary swap file problems, due to lack of space for temporary files.
   Norton recommends configuring Erase Protect not to protect files with the
   extensions of .TMP and .SWP, and limiting the size of the of Erase Protect to
   2048. Consult your Norton manual for instructions.
