SUMMARY
=======

The Clipboard Viewer (CLIPBRD.EXE) in Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1 may change the font in which its contents are displayed if the application
that supplied the specific font data is exited.

To change the font in which the data is displayed, choose one of the commands on
the Display menu in the Clipboard Viewer. If the application is still running,
the Owner Display command will be available. This command enables the Clipboard
to display the same font description copied or cut into it, as long as the
application that provided the font information remains running. After the
application is exited, the Owner Display command changes to Text, which is the
default Clipboard text format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The OEM Text command on the Display menu refers to the text format used
for non-Windows-based applications.
