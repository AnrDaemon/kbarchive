The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Windows version 3.1 on a Novell network, you have
persistent printer connections, and the print queue no longer exists or was
renamed, then the following error message will be displayed:

   <server>/<print queue> does not map to any volume/directory path
   on server <server name>

This error message appears each time Windows is started.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to disable this message:

Method 1
--------

1. Run Control Panel and choose the Printers icon.

2. Choose the Connect button and connect the LPTx port to another available
   print queue.

3. Select the Permanent check box. This will overwrite the existing settings.

If the connection is not made permanent, the error message at startup will
continue to be displayed.

Method 2
--------

Edit the WIN.INI file's [network] section and delete the LPTx port reference to
the print queue that no longer exists.
