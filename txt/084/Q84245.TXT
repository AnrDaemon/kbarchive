TITLE   :Greek Symbols Appear Instead of Selected Fonts in Windows 3.1

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Fonts display as Greek symbols in Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

This font-mapping problem may occur only in certain applications or after
choosing certain options within an application.

RESOLUTION
==========

The fonts in the [fonts] section of the WIN.INI file may need to be reordered.

This problem occurs most commonly with the Symbol font. To correct this problem,
edit the WIN.INI file and move the SYMBOLx.FON line (where "x" represents a
letter A-F) to end of the [fonts] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When this problem occurs, the application is requesting a font by font family
rather than by font name. In this case, Windows provides the first font in that
family from the [fonts] section of the WIN.INI file. When you upgrade to Windows
3.1, Setup upgrades the [fonts] section and deletes all Windows 3.0 fonts that
no longer apply. This can cause font display problems for applications that ask
for raster fonts by family rather than by name.

Moving fonts in the list can cause different font-mapping problems with other
fonts if you order the fonts incorrectly. When you move fonts, make sure that
the plain text or "normal" version of a font appears first in the list. If you
position italic or bold first, an application may incorrectly map to the italic
or bold font instead of the plain text font. Many applications request the font
name when they want the "normal" version of that font.
