SUMMARY
=======

To enable the MIDI Sequencer warning dialog generated when attempting to play a
non-General MIDI file, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and remove the following line
from the [mciseq.drv] section:

      DisableWarning=TRUE

This line is added when the "Don't display this warning in future" check box is
selected in the non-General MINI warning dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MIDI Sequencer driver supplied with Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1 (MCISEQ.DRV) reads the header of all MIDI files before attempting to
play them. If the driver does not find the flag indicating that the file is in
General MIDI format, it generates a warning message reading:

   This file may not play correctly with the default MIDI setup.

   [] Don't display this warning in future.

The MIDI Sequencer warning message indicates that the file has not been flagged
as General MIDI and may not play properly in Windows 3.1.

If the Don't Disable This Warning In Future check box has been selected, this
dialog box will not be evoked when non-General MIDI files are read in the
future.
