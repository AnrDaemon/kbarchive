SUMMARY
=======

The keystrokes to bring a specific card to the front of a file in Microsoft
Windows Cardfile are different from the keystrokes used in the Windows 3.0
Cardfile program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Windows 3.0 Cardfile program, to bring a specific card to the front of
the file, hold down the CTRL key and type a letter. A card beginning with that
letter is moved to the foreground.

In the Windows 3.1 Cardfile program, to bring a specific card to the front of the
file, hold down the CTRL+SHIFT keys and press the appropriate letter to bring a
specific card to the front of a file.

For example, in the Windows 3.0 Cardfile program, pressing CTRL+W would display
the first card in the file that starts with the letter "W". In the Windows 3.1
Cardfile program, pressing CTRL+SHIFT+W will display the first card with the
letter "W".
