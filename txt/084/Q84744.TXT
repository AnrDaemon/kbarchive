SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes it is helpful to conditionally have a starting label specified with
the END directive; for example, to use preprocessor directives to specify
various END directives:

   IFDEF xyz
     END start_label
   ELSE
     END
   ENDIF

Note, however, that this approach will not work. As soon as MASM encounters the
first END directive it will stop assembling. The assembler stops regardless of
whether or not the END directive is inside a preprocessor block. This is the
expected behavior for the assembler.

A method that can be used to accomplish this task involves using a conditionally
defined text equate with the END directive. The following sample code
demonstrates this method:

Sample Code
-----------

   ; Assemble options needed: /Dxyz

   .MODEL small

   .STACK 4096

   .CODE
   start_label:
     mov ax, 4C00h
     int 21h

   IFDEF xyz
     end_label EQU <start_label>
   ELSE
     end_label EQU <>
   ENDIF

   END end_label
