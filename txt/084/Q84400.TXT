-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

New installations (as opposed to upgrades) of Windows 3.1 will not have the
LPT1.OS2 or LPT2.OS2 ports selections available in the Printers Connect section
of the Control Panel or in Print Manager. Choose LPT1.DOS or LPT2.DOS instead.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 77 of the "Getting Started with Microsoft Windows" booklet for Windows 3.1
incorrectly states:

   If you are printing to LPT1, try printing to the LPT1.OS2 file instead. To
   specify the LPT1.OS2 file, choose the Printers icon in Control Panel. When
   the Printers dialog box appears, choose the Connect button. Choose LPT1.OS2
   from the Ports list. If LPT1.OS2 does not appear in the list, you need to add
   it to the list of ports in the ports section of the WIN.INI file.

If you upgraded to Windows 3.1 from Windows 3.0, the LPTx.OS2 options will be
listed in the Ports section of the WIN.INI unless the options were removed
manually. Upgrading to Windows 3.1 preserves the LPTx.OS2 port listings in the
WIN.INI. If Windows 3.1 was set up as a new installation, the new port listings
of LPT1.DOS and LPT2.DOS will be available.

The LPTx.OS2 and LPTx.DOS listings are alternative port selections for
troubleshooting Windows printing problems while printing directly to the port.
Choosing one of these ports causes Windows to print to a file that is handled by
MS-DOS and then sent to the appropriate port for printing.
