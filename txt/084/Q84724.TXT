The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 32-bit disk access feature of Microsoft Windows version 3.1 may
not work with the Microsolutions Compaticard.

The Compaticard model 4 meets the 32-bit disk access requirements
because it is Western Digital (WD) 1003 compatible. However, the
Compaticard allows you to attach either external or internal floppy
disk drives to your system. It has its own built-in BIOS that alters
the I/O address.

If you remove this BIOS, 32-bit disk access should work fine.

For additional information on configuring the Compaticard, please
contact Microsolutions.

Compaticard is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
