-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet driver (HPDSKJET.DRV) for the HP
DeskJet, DeskJet Plus, HP DeskJet 500, or HP DeskJet 560c, incorrect TrueType
font output may result when a third-party screen driver is installed. Installing
one of the standard screen drivers provided with Windows 3.1 should correct this
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This information applies only to the HPDSKJET driver provided with Windows 3.1,
not to the DJ500C.DRV HP DeskJet driver provided by Hewlett-Packard. The easiest
way to tell the difference between these two drivers (other than examining the
contents of the WIN.INI file) is to see how the printer is described in Control
Panel. The driver written by HP lists the printer name as "HP Deskjet Series v
2.x", where 2.x is either 2.0 or 2.1. The driver provided with Windows 3.1 lists
the printer name as "HP Deskjet", "HP Deskjet Plus", or "HP Deskjet 500".
