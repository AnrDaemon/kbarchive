SUMMARY
=======

A version of the Windows 3.1 Help Compiler which has been enhanced to use
extended memory is now available in the Microsoft Download Center. The extended
memory version of the Windows 3.1 Help Compiler (HCP.EXE) generates files for
the Windows 3.1 Help application. As with all previous versions of the Windows
Help Compiler, the new version runs under MS-DOS. However, the new version
requires extended memory and is best run in an MS- DOS session under Windows.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The size and complexity of the files processed by earlier versions of the Windows
Help Compiler is constrained by the amount of free MS-DOS memory available at
compile time. This capacity constraint has caused difficulties for some
developers creating very large files for Windows Help. The HCP.EXE application
removes this capacity constraint.

For more information on the Windows Help Compiler, see Chapter 3 of the
"Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programming Tools" for version 3.1
manual.
