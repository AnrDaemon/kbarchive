SUMMARY
=======

The StartUp group is a new group that is added to the Program Manager during
Windows version 3.1 installation.

If you place a program item for an application in the StartUp group, the
application starts each time Windows 3.1 is loaded.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you delete the StartUp group and need to re-create it, follow these
procedures:

NOTE: If you had any program icons in the StartUp group that were corrupt when
the group was deleted, they are not recovered. You need to add them manually.

1. From the File menu in Program Manager, choose New to open the New Program
   Object Window.

2. Select Program Group, then press ENTER.

3. In the Program Group Properties Window, type the following in the Description
   box:

   StartUp

   NOTE: If you leave this box empty, the StartUp Group does not function
   correctly (nothing starts).

4. On the Group File line, type the following

   [drive]:\[directory]\startup.grp

   where [drive] is the drive letter that Windows 3.1 has been loaded on and
   [directory] is the name of the Windows directory.

5. Press ENTER to complete re-creating the StartUp group.
