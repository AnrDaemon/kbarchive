SUMMARY
=======

The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit: Programmer's Reference, Volume
2: Functions" manual contains an error regarding the proper use of the
DestroyCursor and DestroyIcon functions. This error is repeated a number of
times throughout the manual. This article lists the various changes required to
correct the error.

The manual states that when an application loads a cursor using the LoadCursor
function, it should delete the cursor using the DestroyCursor function.
Likewise, the manual states that when an application loads an icon using the
LoadIcon function, it should delete the icon using the DestroyIcon function.
These two statements are incorrect. DestroyCursor is used only on cursors
created with the CreateCursor function and DestroyIcon is used only on icons
created with the CreateIcon function.

To address this problem, make the following four changes to the "Microsoft
Windows SDK: Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual:

 - On page 216, modify the documentation for the DestroyCursor function to
   remove the reference to LoadCursor.

 - On page 216, modify the documentation for the DestroyIcon function to remove
   the reference to LoadIcon.

 - On page 576, modify the documentation for the LoadCursor function to replace
   the following line An application should use the DestroyCursor function to
   destroy any private cursors it loads with the following line:

   An application should use the <B>DestroyCursor</B> function to destroy
   any private cursors it creates with the <B>CreateCursor</B> function.

 - On page 577, modify the documentation for the LoadIcon function to replace
   the following line:

   An application should use the DestroyIcon function to destroy
   any private icons it loads.

   with the following line:

   An application should use the <B>DestroyIcon</B> function to destroy
   any private icons it creates using the <B>CreateIcon</B> function.
