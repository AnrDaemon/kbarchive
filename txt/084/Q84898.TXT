TITLE   :Novell Printing May Cause Incomplete or Corrupt Output
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document from Microsoft Windows over a Novell network, graphics
in the document may be printed in narrow bands across the last half of the page
or have stripes of unprinted regions.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by an incorrect entry in your Novell login script.

WORKAROUND
==========

A possible workaround is to add the following time increment parameter (ti=) to
the Novell CAPTURE command in your login script

   capture s=??? q=xxxxx nff nt nb ti=tttt

where:

   ???=server name
   xxxxx=queue name
   tttt=time value (default is 10--try a minimum of 20)
   nff=no formfeed
   nt=no tab
   nb=no banner
   ti=time increment

MORE INFORMATION
================

In your login script, the printer CAPTURE command determines your network
printer. When there is not enough time to print a job, the network times out on
the job and then picks it up again. This can cause incomplete graphics when
printing over a network. Increasing the time increment to 20 may keep the
network from timing out on the job before the software has had a chance to
complete the transmission: 20 seconds is the minimum for most graphics.
Complicated graphics may need ti=40. Complex color pictorial graphics may need
ti=400. Keep in mind that setting a longer time-out period slows down the entire
printing process.
