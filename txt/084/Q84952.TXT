SUMMARY
=======

You should run the Playroom Software CapsKey utility before using Microsoft
Windows Macro Recorder (RECORDER.EXE). If you do not run CapsKey first, Recorder
macros may not function properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CapsKey is a program that forces the CAPS LOCK key to behave as if it is
"sticky." That is, a key press will remain active until you press the SHIFT key.
CapsKey is distributed with the Playroom Software Makeover package.

If, at any time during a Windows session, CapsKey is run AFTER the Recorder,
CapsKey may render Recorder macros inoperable. If this occurs, Exit Recorder
then restart it.

To correct this problem, run CapsKey before you run Recorder.
