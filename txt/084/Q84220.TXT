The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 Setup program does not detect
incompatible terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs if they were loaded into
upper memory with Quarterdeck's load high command. If this occurs, problems may
arise during Windows installation and operation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Quarterdeck's load high utilities are LOADHI.COM and LOADHI.SYS. If these
commands were used, a statement similar to the following may appear in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

      LOADHI /R:2 PC-CACHE

The above statement loads PC-CACHE.COM into upper memory.

To deactivate the TSR, place "REM" in front of the LOADHI statement or remove the
whole line from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. Restart the computer to
make the changes take effect.

LOADHI.COM and LOADHI.SYS are manufactured by Quarterdeck, vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
