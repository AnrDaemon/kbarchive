SUMMARY
=======

The Express Setup option for Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 does
not allow you to change the source disk drive letter after Setup has been
started.

For example, suppose you copy the contents of Disk 3 to a temporary directory on
the hard disk and then run Setup from drive A. When Disk 3 is asked for, you
will not be able to give Setup the path to the temporary directory.

To change the source disk location during Setup, you must use the Custom Setup
option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, Express Setup only looks for source files on the floppy disk drive
from which the SETUP.EXE file was started. However, Custom Setup prompts you at
every disk for the location of the file(s).

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11
