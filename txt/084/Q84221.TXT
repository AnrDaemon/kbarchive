SUMMARY
=======

After installing Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 onto a CompuAdd
325TFX or 325NX laptop, you may experience a problem running MS-DOS-based
applications such as the MS-DOS Prompt.

According to CompuAdd technical support, you can work around this problem by
installing Windows 3.1 for the VGA (version 3.0) display driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After installing or upgrading to Windows version 3.1's standard VGA video
driver, you may experience a problem when running MS-DOS-based applications,
where the screen on the 325NX displays a reversed black video and lock or hang,
and the 352TFX does the same thing, but with a reversed white screen.

This situation may be corrected by installing the VGA (version 3.0) driver
available in Setup. Do the following:

1. Exit Windows and change to the WINDOWS directory.

2. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

3. Select the Display option and press ENTER.

4. Select the VGA (version 3.0) display option and press ENTER.
