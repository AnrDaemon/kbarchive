======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1992 edition 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a low-memory situation exists when running Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows,
you will receive an "Unable to display picture" box in the Bookshelf window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Bookshelf for Windows manual lists the minimum hardware requirements to
display text and graphics in Bookshelf. The requirements are as follows.

1. A personal computer with a 286 or higher processor. Shortly after Bookshelf
   for Windows shipped, the MPC marketing council changed the minimum
   specification for the processor to a 386sx. Bookshelf should be able to
   display pictures on either processor.

2. Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 or later

3. MS-DOS or PC-DOS operating system version 3.1 or later

4. Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) version 2.2 or later

5. 1 MB RAM, a CD-ROM drive, and a hard disk (Microsoft Mouse or compatible
   mouse recommended)

6. An EGA, VGA, 8514/A, or compatible video graphics adapter and monitor (VGA or
   VGA+ recommended)

To determine if the "Unable to display picture" message is generated from a
low-memory situation, rename the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and create
the following two files with the following information:

CONFIG.SYS
----------

DEVICE=C:\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
DEVICE=CD DEVICE DRIVER w/ appropriate parameters (e.g. /d:cdrom01...)
DOS=HIGH

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS
PROMPT $P$G
SET TEMP = C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
MSCDEX.EXE with appropriate parameters (e.g. /d:cdrom01 /m:8 /l:f /v)

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Load SMARTDrive on the system and set the minimum and maximum cache size to
   consume most of the system memory. For example, if the machine contains 8 MB,
   then increase SMARTDrive to approximately 7 MB.

2. Restart the system and start Windows.

3. Start a Bookshelf application such as The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia. An
   "Unable to display picture" box appears in the upper-right corner where the
   bitmap and push buttons should be.

Note: RAMDRIVE, EMM386.EXE, and other utilities that can access extended memory
can be used in place of SMARTDrive.
