SUMMARY
=======

Microphone II, by Software Ventures Corporation, replaces the default Windows
communications driver (COMM.DRV) with its own communications driver
(COMM_SVC.DRV) in the [Boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

      [Boot]
      COMM.DRV=COMM_SVC.DRV

When running Microphone II through Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.1, Software Ventures technical support recommends using the default Windows
3.1 COMM.DRV driver.

      [Boot]
      COMM.DRV=COMM.DRV

MORE INFORMATION

Using COMM_SVC.DRV in Windows 3.1 may cause one or more of the following
problems:

1. 386 enhanced mode restarts the system when accessing a communication port.

2. The error message

   The current port is assigned to a DOS application...

   appears.

3. In the Ports option in Control Panel, the Advanced button is unavailable
   (dimmed). Normally, the Advanced button is available after you choose the
   Settings button from the Ports option.
