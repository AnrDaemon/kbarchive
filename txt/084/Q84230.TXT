SUMMARY
=======

According to DPT technical support, if you use the DPT hard drive controller
model 2011 or 2012B with the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, you
must use ROM version 2G as a minimum. The latest version of ROM for these cards
is 3C. The 3C version has a number of speed improvements. Without a correct ROM
version, you may experience cross-linked files and problems running in 386
enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one of the following three methods to determine what version of ROM you
have:

 - Start the computer and note the ROM version information from the DPT banner
   screen.

   -or-

 - Run the DPTTEST.EXE program that comes with the card; it will display the ROM
   version.

   -or-

 - Look at the two ROMs on the upper left-hand corner of the card. Find the chip
   that begins with FWxxxx; the next line will display the ROM version.

NOTE: SMARTdrive may require the /double_buffer+ switch in the CONFIG.SYS file if
the controller is not Virtual DMA Services (VDS) compliant.

NOTE: If you are using Quarterdeck's QEMM memory manager, it is necessary to
contact Quarterdeck or DPT technical support to adjust the way QEMM monitors INT
13h.
