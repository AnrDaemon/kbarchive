-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article provides information on how to obtain public information about
TrueType fonts, specifications, and developer issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files TTSPEC1.ZIP, TTSPEC2.ZIP, TTSPEC3.ZIP, TTFDUMP.ZIP, TTFNAME.ZIP,
TT-WIN.ZIP, EMBEDDIN.ZIP, TT-TALK.ZIP, and LUCIDA.ZIP are available from the
following sources:

 - CompuServe. Type "GO MSDR" (without the quotation marks) to go to the
   developer relations forum.

 - Internet anonymous FTP. The address for Internet is 137.39.1.9. The files are
   in the VENDOR\MICROSOFT directory.

These files can be downloaded and then decompressed with PKUNZIP.EXE.

TrueType Developer Information Files
------------------------------------

1. The TrueType specifications are as follows:

   TTSPEC1.ZIP
   TTSPEC2.ZIP
   TTSPEC3.ZIP

   These three compressed files contain "TrueType Font Files Specifications," a
   400-page book that details how to construct a TrueType font from scratch (or
   how to build a tool to do so), the TrueType programming language, and the
   complete format of each subtable contained in the .TTF file (including
   illustrations). These documents are stored in Word for Windows 2.0 format and
   require Windows 3.1 to be printed. Refer to the README.DOC (in TTSPEC1.ZIP)
   for printing instructions. These files require 2.5 MB of disk space after
   decompression.

2. TTFDUMP.ZIP, when decompressed, translates the contents of a TrueType font
   into a readable format. It allows you to translate the entire font or just
   specific subtables. This tool, combined with the specifications above, allows
   very effective debugging and/or exploration of any TrueType font.

3. TTFNAME.ZIP contains sample C source code on how to parse the contents of a
   TrueType font. This particular example opens the file and locates the font
   name contained within the "name" table. This compressed .ZIP file also
   contains many useful included files that have predefined structures set up
   for the internal tables of a TrueType font file. This code may be useful for
   developers who want to parse the TrueType data stream returned by the
   GetFontData API function in Windows 3.1.

4. TT-WIN.ZIP contains a 31-page Word for Windows 2.0 document that is targeted
   at the Windows developer who is interested in learning about some of the
   capabilities TrueType adds to Windows 3.1. This file contains many
   illustrations.

5. EMBEDDIN.ZIP contains a text file that describes all the information
   necessary for a Windows developer to add TrueType font embedding capabilities
   to his or her application. Font embedding allows the application to bundle
   the TrueType fonts that were used in that document and transport it to
   another platform where the document can be viewed or printed correctly.

6. TT-TALK.ZIP contains the TrueType Technical Talks 1 and 2. These text files
   describe some of the things that are happening with TrueType "behind the
   scenes" in Windows 3.1. The first document walks through all the steps that
   occur from when a user first presses a key on the keyboard until that
   character appears on the screen (scaling, hinting, drop-out control, caching,
   and blting). The second talk describes one of the unique features of TrueType
   called nonlinear scaling, which allows the font vendor to overcome some of
   the physical limitations of low-resolution output devices.

7. LUCIDA.ZIP contains a text file with useful typographic information on the 22
   Lucida fonts that are included in the Microsoft TrueType Font Pack for
   Windows. It gives pointers on line layout, mixing and matching fonts in the
   family, and a brief history of each font. This information was written by the
   designers of the fonts, Chuck Bigelow & Kris Holmes.
