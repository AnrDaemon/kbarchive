-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During a network installation (SETUP /A) of the ZEOS OEM version of Windows 3.1,
the following error message may appear:

   Setup is unable to copy file X:\...\MOUSE.DRV

   This file already exists in the destination directory and is marked as
   read-only. You must remove the read-only attributes from all the files in
   your Windows directory in order to successfully complete Windows Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This error is generated because ZEOS puts a second, uncompressed, mouse driver
(MOUSE.DRV) on Disk 2 of the Windows 3.1 setup disks. Since Setup marks these
files as read-only, it is unable to copy the second mouse driver file
(MOUSE.DRV). ZEOS puts a second instance of the mouse driver on Disk 2 to allow
it to be copied without having to use the Expand utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, delete or rename either MOUSE.DRV or MOUSE.DR_. They
are the same file, except the MOUSE.DR_ file is compressed.
