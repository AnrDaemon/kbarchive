======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft mouse driver version 8.2 for MS-DOS (MOUSE.COM or
MOUSE.SYS which comes with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1) with
Dell CMOS's system password set for "after boot," the computer may hang after
the password has been entered and any external command is executed (any
executable).

Dell has confirmed this to be a problem and is researching solutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Mouse Driver in AUTOEXEC.BAT
----------------------------

If the mouse driver is used in the AUTOEXEC.BAT

   C:\WINDOWS\MOUSE.COM

then after the computer starts and you enter your password, the system will lock
up after you press ENTER for any external command. This problem will not occur
for any internal command (DIR, CD, and so on).

Once the computer has locked up, pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL will not have any effect.

Mouse Driver in CONFIG.SYS
--------------------------

If the mouse driver is used in the CONFIG.SYS file

       DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\MOUSE.SYS

the system will lock up when you start the system and the mouse driver will be
reported as not loaded.

Note: At this point it will be necessary to start with a system disk that also
contains a CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

If the system password is set to be activated "before boot," then the problem
does not exist.

How to Activate Dell CMOS Password
----------------------------------

The Dell CMOS setup is activated by the following keys pressed simultaneously:

   CTRL+ALT+ENTER

To get to the screen containing the password options, press the following keys
simultaneously:

   ALT+N  (N = next screen)
