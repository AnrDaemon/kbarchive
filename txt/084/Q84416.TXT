-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you may receive the following
error message:

   General Protection Fault Error in module VPWINLIB.DLL

This error occurs in version 4.0 of Ventura for Windows and can be corrected by
freeing up more memory for Ventura's use.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ventura 4.0 for Windows requires at least 3 MB of free RAM (conventional plus
extended memory) to run with standard mode Windows. After installing Windows
3.1, less memory is available to Ventura for operation.

Ventura technical support suggests that you not load unnecessary TSRs and device
drivers that may take up conventional and extended memory (if loaded into the
UMA, upper memory area).

Also, set the BUFFERS statement in the CONFIG.SYS file to at least 15. The TEMP
variable should point to its own TEMP directory contained in the root directory.
(There may be problems with Ventura's operation when the TEMP variable is set to
the root directory, the MS-DOS directory, or a directory contained on a RAM
drive.)

For additional information, contact Ventura Technical Support.

The Ventura products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
