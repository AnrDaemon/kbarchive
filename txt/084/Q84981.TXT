SUMMARY
=======

Some applications are designed to place an icon at a fixed location on the
screen where the icon must remain. One application of this type is the FIXDICON
sample in the Microsoft Download Center. When the user minimizes the
application, it draws an icon on the screen. If the user drags the icon with the
mouse, the icon "snaps back" to its specified position. If the user chooses the
Arrange Icons button in the Task Manager's Task List, the icon appears
momentarily at a new position assigned by Windows. Then it returns to the
position assigned by the application.

In the FIXDICON sample, the window procedure for the main window processes the
WM_MOVE message. If the window is represented as an icon, the application calls
the SetWindowPos function to position the icon at its specified position.
