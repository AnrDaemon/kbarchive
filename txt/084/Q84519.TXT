-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Micronet SCSI controller with EMM386.EXE version 4.44 may lead to loss
of data when running Microsoft Windows operating system 3.1 or MS-DOS- based
applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

MNDOSM.SYS comes with the SCSI controller and should be loaded in the CONFIG.SYS
file to correct this problem.

You should have received this driver with your controller card. One exception
would be when the SCSI controller is used on an OS/2 dual boot machine. You may
have only received the OS/2 driver. Contact Micronet Technical Support to
receive the driver for MS-DOS.
