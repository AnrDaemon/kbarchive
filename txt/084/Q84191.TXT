 - Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A protected mode MS-DOS application can use the MS-DOS Protected Mode Interface
(DPMI) to access the services provided by the enhanced mode of the Microsoft
Windows graphical environment, versions 3.0 and 3.1. Proton.exe is a sample that
demonstrates how to use DPMI. Proton.exe contains the source to an MS-DOS
application that switches itself into protected mode, performs various protected
mode tasks, and then terminates, returning back to real mode MS-DOS.

The documentation for DPMI is available from Intel. In the United States, call
(800) 548-4725. Outside the US, contact the appropriate Intel subsidiary or
distributor.
