-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may not be able to set up Microsoft Windows version 3.1 on a hard drive that
was partitioned with Konan TenTimes HD controller software. When running Windows
3.1 Setup, the installation may fail or lock up when switching from
character-based Setup to graphics-mode Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Konan TenTimes HD controller Setup program (TENSETUP.EXE) will normally
low-level format, partition, and high-level format the drive. The drive then
requires the device driver TENTIME.SYS be loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file to
properly access any drive higher than drive C (for example, drive D, E, and so
on).

Windows 3.1 Setup program will not be able to complete normally if the hard drive
was formatted using the TenTimes partitioning method.

TenTimes has confirmed this to be a problem with its partitioning software. For
additional information, please contact TenTimes at (602) 940-9800.

There is an option in the TenTimes Setup program to perform a standard MS-DOS
partition and format of the hard drive. According to TenTimes, if the drive is
partitioned and formatted this way, Windows 3.1 should install and function
correctly. Note: This has not been tested yet by TenTimes or Microsoft.

Additional information will be posted here as it becomes available.

The TenTimes product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
