-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1, the PIF Editor has
an Allow Fast Paste check box. This setting tells Windows how to paste text into
an MS-DOS-based application.

Some applications may not receive text properly if Allow Fast Paste is selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

To change this setting:

1. Run PIF Editor.

2. Choose the Advanced button.

3. Under Other Options, select or clear the Allow Fast Paste check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Allow Fast Paste check box is selected, Windows will paste the
information into the MS-DOS-based application using an Interrupt 16h call, which
pushes characters and scan codes into the BIOS keyboard buffer. This allows
Windows to send more than one character at a time from the Clipboard to the
MS-DOS-based application.

If the Allow Fast Paste check box is not selected, Windows will paste the
information into the MS-DOS-based application using an Interrupt 9h call to
emulate actual keyboard input. Information will be pasted into the MS-DOS- based
application character by character.
