SUMMARY
=======

When you choose the Mystify screen saver in Windows operating system version
3.1, Mystify defaults to object shape Polygon 1, even if you have previously
selected Polygon 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Polygon 1 and Polygon 2 specify how many polygons are available when the Mystify
screen saver is running. For example, if you select Polygon 1 and select the
Active check box, Mystify will show only one polygon on the screen if you did
not select the Active check box for Polygon 2, and vice- versa.

If you select the Active check box for both Polygon 1 and Polygon 2, two polygons
will appear when Mystify screen saver runs. If you don't select Active for
either polygon, there will be no polygons on the screen. The screen will be
blank and act the same as the Blank Screen screen saver.

NOTE: The Blank Screen screen saver does not have any setup options. To obtain
password protection with Blank Screen, select Mystify but don't select the
Active check box for either polygon, OR select Marquee without any text.
