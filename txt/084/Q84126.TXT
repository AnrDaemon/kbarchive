The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

If the build number of the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.1
does not match the build number of Windows 3.1, the debugging version of Windows
may not run correctly. This situation is an issue only for those customers who
participated in the Windows 3.1 prerelease program.

To resolve any possible conflicts, completely remove any prerelease version of
Windows 3.1 and the Windows SDK 3.1 from your system and reinstall each package
from the retail distribution.

For more information on installing the Windows SDK version 3.1, including an
article that provides the recommended installation procedure, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   " windows and sdk and Setins " (without the quotation marks)

Additional query words: 3.10 no32bit
