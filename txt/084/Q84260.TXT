 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to the Okidata ML 380 from Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the
printer stops on the last line printed and does not eject the page.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is by design. The printer behaves similarly when you print from the MS- DOS
command prompt.

If this behavior is not acceptable, you can use the Epson LQ-2550 emulation and
the LQ-2550 printer driver. This causes the last page to eject after the last
line is printed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an extra page is ejected after the print job is finished, make sure you have
the correct Paper Feed option selected for your printer setup. If you have
Tractor selected when you are using cut-sheet paper, an extra sheet is ejected
after the print job is finished. To change the paper source:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Select the Okidata printer driver you want to configure from the Installed
   Printers list box.

3. Choose the Setup button.

4. From the Paper Source list box, select the correct option for your printer
   configuration.

5. Choose the OK button to save the changes.
