SUMMARY
=======

If you lose one or more groups when installing Norton Desktop for Windows (NDW)
in Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the group(s) can be
restored.

All of the NDW group files are stored with an extension of .QAG. In NDW 2.0 it's
possible to open up a drive window displaying the files in the WINDOWS
directory, and drag and drop the .QAG files into the Quick Access Group icon or
window.

To restore the groups in NDW 1.x and 2.0, do the following:

1. From the File menu, choose New.

2. Select New Group.

3. Type the group description.

4. Either choose Browse to find the correct .QAG file or type the correct .QAG
   filename.
