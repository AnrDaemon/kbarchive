======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows, File Manager does not update the drive information (files
and directories) for a drive that has more than one window open if the disk is
changed.

To show the correct contents of the disk, choose Refresh from the Window menu or
press F5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When there is more than one drive window open for a given drive, the window
instance is displayed in the title bar of the drive. The following is an example
of the title bar for a second window opened on drive A:

   A:\*.*:2 [LABEL]

The :2 is the second drive window that has been opened for drive A.

If at anytime the disk, is changed when there are multiple window instances for
the drive, the Refresh (F5) option will have to be used to obtain the correct
disk contents. Selecting, clicking, or double-clicking the drive icon or the
drive folder, or choosing Select Drive from the Disk menu will NOT update the
window.

This behavior is by design.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 refresh directory
