SUMMARY
=======

When starting applications from Program Manager in Windows 3.1, you can specify
the working directory in the Program Item Properties dialog box. (To access this
dialog box, choose Properties from the File menu in Program Manager.) There are
several reasons that an application may start with a different default directory
than the one specified in the Program Item Properties dialog box.

Some applications have the ability to set the default directory. This always
overrides Windows 3.1's attempt to specify a default directory as specified in
either the Program Item Properties dialog box or a PIF.

The Working Directory setting in the Program Item Properties dialog box always
has precedence over the Startup Directory in a PIF.

Applications that override the PIF and/or Program Item Properties dialog box
entries implement this feature in different ways. For example, version 2.0 of
Word for Windows has a DOC-PATH= setting in the WIN.INI file for the default
directory for documents. WordPerfect version 5.1 has a setting in a .ENV
(environment) file.

The WordPerfect product included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
