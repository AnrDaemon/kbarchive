The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, if a program information file
(PIF) for an MS-DOS application already exists, a dialog box will appear and
provide an option to create a new PIF, replace an existing PIF, or cancel the
request.

In Windows 3.0, running the Set Up Applications command from the Windows Setup
icon creates a new PIF for each MS-DOS application that it recognizes from the
[PIF] section of the SETUP.INF file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up MS-DOS applications to run in Windows 3.0 or 3.1, do the following:

1. From the Program Manager, choose the Windows Setup icon.

2. From the Options menu, choose Set Up Applications.

Windows searches the [PIF] section of the SETUP.INF for Windows 3.0 or the
APPS.INF file for Windows 3.1 for MS-DOS applications and uses the related
information to create the PIF.

The PIF filename conventions are as follows:

For Windows 3.1, the Set Up Applications program displays the following message
when it encounters an existing PIF for an MS-DOS application:

   A program information file (PIF) for <name of MS-DOS application>
   already exists: <PIF name>. The existing PIF may provide Windows with
   special instructions about running <name of DOS application>.

   To preserve the existing PIF and set up an additional PIF for <name of DOS
   application>, choose Create. This also creates a new Program Manager icon
   for <name of DOS application> so you can run <name of DOS
   application> using the new PIF.

   To replace <PIF name> with a new PIF, choose Replace. This creates a new
   Program Manager icon for <name of DOS application> and any existing
   Program Manager icons that refer to <PIF name> will use this new PIF.

   To preserve the existing PIF without creating a new Program Manager icon,
   choose Cancel.

If you choose Create, Windows creates a new PIF and adds sequential numbers to
the new filename. The list of PIFs will then look as follows:

   WORD5.PIF
   WORD500.PIF
   WORD501.PIF

In Windows 3.0, a number is substituted for the last letter of the filename (not
the extension). For example, several PIFs for WORD for MS-DOS would be created
as follows:

   WORD5.PIF
   WORD0.PIF
   WORD1.PIF
   WORD2.PIF

In this example, Set Up Applications was invoked three times with the original
PIF being WORD5.PIF. Windows also creates a new icon using the last PIF created.
The original icons are not replaced. However, if the previous icon is deleted,
it is also safe to delete the previous PIF.
