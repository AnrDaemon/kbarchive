SUMMARY
=======

The Panasonic KX-P1180 driver for Windows 3.1 does not properly generate lines
and other graphics when used with WordPerfect for Windows. Although lines and
graphics display correctly using the Print Preview command, output to the
printer is not correct.

The KX-P1180 printer driver generates correct graphics when used with other
applications, such as Paintbrush.
