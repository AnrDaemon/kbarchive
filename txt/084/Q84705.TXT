======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using an IBM PS/2 model 90 or 95, and you run an MS-DOS- based
application with standard VGA selected, when you press ALT+ENTER to run the
application in a window, the screen may become corrupt.

Forcing the screen to redraw usually clears the screen.

CAUSE
=====

IBM PS/2 models 90 and 95 are not fully compatible with Microsoft Windows
version 3.1's standard VGA driver. The XGA card built into the model 95 lacks
the ability to understand the VGA virtual display driver (*VDDVGA) built into
WIN386.EXE, and the 386 grabber file (VGA.3GR).

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the PS/2 model 90 and 95 as XGA (640 x 480, 16
colors), as detected by Setup, or set up for one of the other XGA displays.
