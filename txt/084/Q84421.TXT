 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

If the Granularity option in the Desktop section of Control Panel is set too
high, windows that are moved may shake erratically in Program Manager. A high
granularity setting can also result in the inability to move a window in Program
Manager once it has been placed somewhere on the desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Granularity defines the coarseness of an invisible grid that objects are placed
upon on the desktop. This invisible grid could be compared to a piece of graph
paper. Each intersection on the graph paper represents the point at which the
window can rest. The larger the squares on the grid of the graph paper, the
greater the jump the window must take between resting points. The Sizing Grid
Granularity option has a range of 0 to 49. Setting the granularity to any number
greater than zero can cause the window to jump when resized or moved, or may
prevent it from being moved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Select Control Panel from the Main Group in Program Manager.

2. Choose the Desktop icon.

3. From the Sizing Grid section of the Desktop dialog box, reduce the number
   value representing Granularity.
