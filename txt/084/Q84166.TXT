SUMMARY
=======

If a computer's BIOS incorrectly detects a math coprocessor when one is not
present, improper information may be displayed in areas such as the title bar of
the Microsoft Windows Calculator program and in other Windows-based programs.

Phoenix technical support has confirmed that some system manufacturers might have
incorrectly shipped BIOS that supports the Intel 80486DX only, not the BIOS that
also supports the Intel 80486SX chip. This situation causes the erroneous
reporting of a math coprocessor on the 80486SX when there is none, and may
produce these errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The incorrect detection of a math coprocessor can cause problems in Windows. The
value "-1" may be displayed for the cursor position. Strings such as "sin:" or
"sqrt:" may be displayed randomly in title bars and other places. The value
"-1#.QNAN" might be displayed if the Clear button is chosen in Calculator.

To resolve this problem, contact your computer manufacturer, not Phoenix for the
correct BIOS for your computer system.

The Intel and Phoenix products included here are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
