SUMMARY
=======

Librex brand notebook computers require the video patch LIBVGA.EXE to run an
MS-DOS-based application in a full screen in 386 enhanced mode. If the patch is
not loaded, video anomalies may be experienced, including a darkened or tinted
screen when switching between applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LIBVGA.EXE is a VGA patch available from Librex that prevents the Windows color
palette from becoming corrupted when an MS-DOS-based application is run in a
full screen in 386 enhanced mode.

LIBVGA.EXE should be used when running Windows 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.1. The standard
VGA video driver should be used in Windows 3.0 and 3.0a. The XGA (640 x 480 16
colors) video driver should be chosen when running Windows 3.1.

Librex technical support recommends contacting the local Librex dealer as the
quickest means of obtaining the patch; however, LIBVGA.EXE can be obtained
directly from Librex technical support.

To install LIBVGA.EXE:

1. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and add
   the following line

   [drive]\[dir]\LIBVGA.EXE

   where [drive] refers to the drive that contains the LIBVGA.EXE driver, and
   [dir] refers to the appropriate directory that contains LIBVGA.EXE. This line
   should be added to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, before any applications
   or shells, and AFTER any mouse drivers.

2. Save the file.

3. Restart the system.
