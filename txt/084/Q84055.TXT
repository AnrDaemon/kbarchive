-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When certain Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) functions are used with a
printer Device Context (DC), the functions do not affect the printed results.

CAUSE
=====

The printer is a banding device and the application is not performing banding.

RESOLUTION
==========

Modify the application to perform banding or remove any GDI functions that are
not supported by metafiles. The "Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Reference Volume 1" for version 3.0 lists on pages 2-41 and 2-42 the functions
that are valid in a metafile, and the "Microsoft Windows SDK: Programmer's
Reference, Volume 1: Overview," for version 3.1 lists the valid functions on
page 107; however, these lists contain some errors. To obtain an updated list of
valid functions, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   prod(winsdk) and metafile and valid and functions

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application prints to a banding device and does not perform banding,
Windows GDI collects all the output function calls and creates a metafile.
During the process of printing, GDI plays this metafile into each of the bands
received from the printer driver. Any functions that are not supported in
metafiles do not work under this scenario.

For more information on adding banding to an application, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   prod(winsdk) and banding and application

Other sources of information are Chapter 12 of the "Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit Guide to Programming" for version 3.0 and "Programming Windows"
by Charles Petzold (Microsoft Press).
