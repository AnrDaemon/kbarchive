SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows version 3.1, you must use the IBM Graphics printer
driver to print correctly to a Diconix 300W printer. The printer documentation
provided with the Diconix 300W lists the Epson FX-100+ and the Epson FX-185 as
the emulation modes for the printer. If either of these printer drivers are used
with the Diconix 300W, you receive the following error message:

   Cannot print to LPT1:

Use the IBM Graphics driver to eliminate this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This does not apply to Windows 3.0. Under Windows 3.0, the Epson FX-100+ or the
Epson FX-185 drivers should be used when printing to the Diconix 300W.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
