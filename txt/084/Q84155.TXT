SUMMARY
=======

Some of the networks supported by Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1
such as Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1 and Novell NetWare provide
"network-specific" dialog boxes for File Manager, Print Manager, and the
Printers option in Control Panel.

To disable these special dialog boxes and use Windows 3.1 common dialog boxes:

1. Open the WIN.INI file in a standard text editor, such as Notepad.

2. Add the following:

         [network]
         defaultdialogs=1

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the Microsoft LAN Manager 2.1 network specific dialog box in File
Manager does not support the Previous button that allows you to connect to
servers that you have connected to in the past, without retyping the entire
server/resource name.

Additional query words: 3.10 3.11 faster connections
