The Omit Picture Format command in the Options menu in Paintbrush is used
to choose which format is used when an image is placed in the Clipboard.
With Omit Picture Format turned off (the default), when an image is cut or
copied to the Clipboard, it is placed in the Clipboard as both a metafile
and device independent bitmap (DIB). If Omit Picture Format is selected,
the image is placed in the Clipboard in the form of a DIB when a Cut or
Copy function is performed.

Some applications such a PageMaker 4.0 may not be able to correctly paste
metafiles. If an application is not able to paste an image that was copied
to the Clipboard from Paintbrush, try selecting Omit Picture Format from
the Options menu in Paintbrush before copying the image to the Clipboard.

If a third-party application requires that Omit Picture Format be selected
in Paintbrush, you may want to contact your software vendor for an update
to correctly paste an image that was copied to the Clipboard from
Paintbrush.
