PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Texas Instruments (TI) Travelmate 3000 computer from
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 to Windows version 3.1, the following error
message may occur when you start Windows 3.1:

   There is a multiple entry in system.ini. Please remove this multiple entry in
   system.ini: device=vkd.386

WORKAROUND
==========

The following is a temporary workaround for the problem:

1. Using a text editor, edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

2. Use a semicolon (;) to remark out the following line from the [386Enh]
   section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

         device=vkd.386

   The line should now appear as follows:

         ;device=vkd.386

This causes Windows to ignore the PS/2 mouse port.

To solve the problem permanently, do the following:

1. Obtain an updated Windows 3.1 compatible version of VKD.386 from Texas
   Instruments and install it following the instructions provided by Texas
   Instruments.

2. Remove the following line from the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file:

         keyboard=*vkd

3. If you remarked out the DEVICE=VKD.386 line in step 2 of the temporary
   workaround above, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and remove the semicolon.
