======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running MS-DOS applications in Microsoft Windows version 3.1 in standard
mode on a Novell network, the Working Directory setting in the Program Item
Properties dialog box, and the Start-up Directory setting in a PIF do not
function if the directory specified is a network drive (not the local hard
drive). This problem does not occur in 386 enhanced mode.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem

1. Create a batch file (for example, APP.BAT) that changes to the desired
   directory, and then starts the MS-DOS application (for example, MYAPP.EXE).

         CD\ 
         U:
         CD\DATA
         C:\MYDIR\MYAPP.EXE

2. Do one of the following:

   a. Change the PIF's Program Filename to APP.BAT:

         Program Filename:       APP.BAT
         Windows Title:          MyApp
         Optional Parameters:
         Start-up Directory:

      -or-

   b. Modify the command line for the icon's properties to APP.BAT:

         Description:            MyApp
         Command Line:           APP.BAT
         Working Directory:
         Shortcut Key:
