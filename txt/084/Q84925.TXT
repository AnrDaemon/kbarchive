SUMMARY
=======

The group windows listing of the PROGMAN.INI file does not have to be in
sequential order for Microsoft Windows version 3.1 to load the group windows
correctly. However, for Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a, this listing must be in
order.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 3.0, the [groups] section of the PROGMAN.INI file must to be in
sequential order for Windows to properly load the groups (as in the example
below).

      [Groups]
      Group1=C:\WIN31\NONWINDO.GRP
      Group2=C:\WIN31\GAMES.GRP
      Group3=C:\WIN31\ACCESSOR.GRP
      Group4=C:\WIN31\MAIN.GRP

In Windows 3.1, the groups listing of the PROGMAN.INI file does not have to be in
sequential order. The group listing can have breaks in the numbering order or be
in any numeral sequence (as in the example below).

      [Groups]
      Group1=C:\WIN31\NONWINDO.GRP
      Group3=C:\WIN31\ACCESSOR.GRP
      Group2=C:\WIN31\GAMES.GRP
      Group4=C:\WIN31\MAIN.GRP
      Group5=C:\WIN31\WindowsA.GRP
      Group10=C:\WIN31\OTHER.GRP
