The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.2, 5.3x, 5.5 
 - Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.0x, 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to run, in MS-DOS, an application generated by Microsoft FORTRAN
version 5.1, fails and generates the following message:

   This program requires Microsoft Windows

If the application is run in Windows, the system may open an MS-DOS session,
display the message above and close the MS-DOS session, returning to Windows
without running the application.

CAUSE
=====

Most likely, one of the following errors occurred linking the application:

   L2025: Multiply Defined Symbol

   L2029: Unresolved External

When one of these errors occurs, Microsoft LINK sets an error bit in the
executable file header. The error bit warns the application loader that the file
contains an error. In Windows, this bit causes the loader to start an MS-DOS
session for the application. If the application is designed for Windows, the
MS-DOS correctly displays the error message above.

If an L2025 or L2029 error occurs creating an application for the MS-DOS
operating system, the loader does not reject the application. However, in the
MS-DOS operating system, running an application that has unresolved externals
may generate incorrect results or cause the system to hang. In the OS/2
operating system, the application generates a general protection (GP) fault if
it attempts to access a restricted memory location.

RESOLUTION
==========

The best method to address this situation involves resolving the LINK error at
its source. If this is not possible or undesirable, use the EXEHDR utility to
manually reset the error bit. The syntax to call the EXEHDR utility is as
follows:

   EXEHDR /r <filename>

STATUS
======

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 of the Windows loader each interpret the error bit as
described above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following FORTRAN code reproduces the problem:

Sample Code
-----------

This is the source code for the SAMPLE.FOR file:

       
     PROGRAM Sample_Test
         PRINT *, 'FORTRAN Test'
         GOTO 20
         CALL MySub (123)          ! MySub is unresolved at link time
    20   CONTINUE
         END
