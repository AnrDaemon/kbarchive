The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to paste text into Paintbrush while in Zoom Out mode, the
following message is displayed:

   Only Text is available on the Clipboard.

   To paste text, use the Zoom Out command, select the Text tool and the
   positions for pasting, and then select the Paste command.

This information is incorrect. The second paragraph should read:

   To paste text, use the Zoom In command, select the Text tool and the
   positions for pasting, and then select the Paste command.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can paste graphic images into Paintbrush in both Zoom In and Zoom Out mode.
However, you can only paste text in Zoom In mode.

Text cannot be pasted into Windows 3.0 Paintbrush; the Paste command is
unavailable (that is, dimmed, or grayed out).

For more information on pasting text in Windows 3.1 Paintbrush, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
