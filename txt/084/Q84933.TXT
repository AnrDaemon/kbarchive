======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Media Player installed in the Accessory group provided with Windows with
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 and with Windows version 3.1 does not
automatically rewind from the end of an audio CD back to the first track. This
behavior occurs with only some multimedia hardware.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, choose CD Audio Player from the Device menu. This
resets the player to the first track of the CD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here asit becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run Media Player from the Accessories group.

2. From the Device menu, choose CD Audio Player, making sure there is an audio
   disc in the drive.

3. Play the CD and allow it to play to the end or seek near the end of the disc
   by sliding the seek bar.

Shortly after reaching the end of the CD, the seek bar should jump to the first
track of the CD. However, on some systems the bar will remain at the end of the
CD.
