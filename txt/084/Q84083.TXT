SUMMARY
=======

If you run WordPerfect for Windows with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and select
the Texas Instruments (TI) OmniLaser printer driver, WordPerfect may add
unexpected formatting characters (such as tabs and spaces) to the current
document.

This printer driver does not add unexpected formatting when used with other
applications, such as Microsoft Windows Write. Also, WordPerfect for Windows
does not add extra formatting characters when used with other Windows 3.1
printer drivers, such as the HP LaserJet III.
