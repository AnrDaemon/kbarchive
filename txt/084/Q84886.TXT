======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can't print TrueType fonts when running Microsoft Windows on a Novell
network.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the PRINTCON.DAT file is not in the SYS directory for
your Novell network installation. One of the functions of PRINTCON.DAT is to set
up the default data stream type. Without a PRINTCON.DAT file, the default is a
"TEXT" data stream.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the Novell PRINTCON utility to generate a
PRINTCON.DAT file with a default data stream of "BITSTREAM". Once this is done,
TrueType fonts should print normally.
