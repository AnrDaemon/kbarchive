SUMMARY
=======

When creating a Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax cover page
with MailSender, it is rasterized at 200-by-200 dpi. Because the cover page is
rasterized at 200-by-200 dpi, a cover page will not be sent when the 200-by-100
dpi "Fastest" resolution option is selected in the Gateway Accounts screen for a
particular account.

No warning is given when the account is configured this way.

Additional query words: 2.00a 2.00b 3.00 faxgate
