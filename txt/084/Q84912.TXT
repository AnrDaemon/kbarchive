TITLE   :Reinstalling WRK May Not Re-Create a WRK Program Group
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1,3.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for the Microsoft Windows operating
system version 3.1 is deleted from the system (including its group and
directory) and reinstalled, a WRK program group may not be recreated when it is
reinstalled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the WRK Setup program checks for a previous WRK
installation by looking for the existence of the following files in the
corresponding locations:

   BMPVIEW.EXE     Specified WRK target directory
   TOPHOOK.DLL     \WINDOWS directory
   VBRUN100.DLL    \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and then \WINDOWS directory

If any one of these files are found, Setup considers there to be a previous WRK
installation on the machine, so it does not create a new WRK program group.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Delete the WRK program group.

2. Delete the \WRK directory. (BMPVIEW.EXE is the only file that requires
   deletion.)

3. Delete VBRUN100.DLL from the \WINDOWS and \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories.

4. Delete TOPHOOK.DLL from the \WINDOWS directory.

5. Run the Setup program for the WRK.

A program group for the WRK should be created when the installation is complete.
