-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Font Compression feature included with Typecase, a third-party application
for Windows, may cause general protection (GP) faults and other system errors
when used with Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

CAUSE
=====

Typecase allows users of Windows 3.1 to selectively activate and deactivate
TrueType fonts. If Typecase is installed, only activated fonts appear as choices
when you are selecting fonts within applications for Windows.

Typecase also includes an option that conserves disk space by compressing
deactivated fonts and leaving only activated fonts uncompressed.

However, if a compressed font is used by bypassing Typecase (for example, by
manually adding font entries to the WIN.INI file), GP faults and other system
errors may occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To remove or disable Typecase, do the following to ensure that no compressed
fonts remain on the system:

1. Run the Typecase program.

2. Select the [All Fonts] entry from the Typecase drop-down box.

3. Select any font in the left-side font list box.

4. Choose the Select All button.

5. Choose the Activate button. If any fonts are currently compressed, this will
   decompress them.

6. Exit Typecase.

Typecase is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
