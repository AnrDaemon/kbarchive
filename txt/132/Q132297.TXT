SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to play the South African National Anthem from Microsoft
Bookshelf 1995 Atlas, one of the following occurs:

 - You may receive the following error message from the MIDI Sequencer:

   This file may not play correctly with the default MIDI setup. Don't display
   this warning in the future.

   NOTE: No speaker will be visible on the opening Southern Africa screen. Move
   the cursor (arrow) until it resembles a small hand and click South Africa
   located towards the bottom of the map. The speaker will appear in the next
   screen.

   -or-

 - The South African anthem does not play.

RESOLUTION
==========

To eliminate the MIDI Sequencer error, make sure the Don't Display This Warning
In The Future box is checked. This adds the following lines to the System.ini
file:

      [mciseq.drv]
      DisableWarning=TRUE

This problem does not occur with the 32-bit version of Microsoft Bookshelf '95
for Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MIDI Sequencer warning message indicates that the file has not been flagged
as General MIDI. The MIDI Sequencer driver supplied with Microsoft Windows 3.x
(MCISEQ.DRV) reads the header of all MIDI files before attempting to play them.
If there is no flag indicating that the file is in General MIDI format, the
above warning message displays.
