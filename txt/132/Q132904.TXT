TITLE   :Windows NT Upgrade Err Msg: ... NtPathToDosPath reported...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::; winnt:3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT, the following error message appears in the
graphical user interface (GUI) portion of Windows NT Setup:

   External library procedure NtPathToDosPath reported the following error.
   'Unable to open the specified symbolic link object.'

CAUSE
=====

This error indicates that the path to the installation media is no longer
accessible. This error occurs when you have added new hardware to the computer
(for example, a SCSI controller, a SCSI CD-ROM drive, or a ATAPI- compatible
CD-ROM drive) before running Setup, but without adding the device drivers in the
original Windows NT installation first. When Windows NT Setup reboots the
computer to continue the GUI portion of setup, Windows NT finds only devices
installed under the previous version of Windows NT (because you are running in
the context of the original Windows NT installation.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

 - If you are upgrading a previous version of Windows NT, ensure the hardware
   you are using operates correctly under the previous version.

 - Run WINNT /B. The /B switch instructs Windows NT Setup to perform a diskless
   installation, eliminating the need for installation media (such as a CD-ROM),
   after rebooting into the GUI portion of Setup.
