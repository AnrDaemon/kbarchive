SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a shortcut for a file on a NetWare 3.x or 4.x server, or on a
Windows 95-based computer running the File And Printer Sharing For NetWare
Networks component, if the file has been removed or renamed the shortcut may
open another similarly named file in the same folder without prompting you. This
behavior can occur with shortcuts that user either mapped drives or UNC paths.

CAUSE
=====

The shortcut facility in Windows 95 deals with missing files by searching for a
file with similar characteristics and prompting you. One of the most prominent
characteristics is the file creation date and time. On NetWare 3.x and 4.x
servers, and Windows 95-based computers running the File And Printer Sharing For
NetWare Networks component, the creation date is set with a resolution of two
seconds. This means that two files copied to the server within a two-second span
may have the same file creation date and time. This can cause the shortcut
facility's missing file detection process to misdetect the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only workaround for this problem is to change the shortcut to point to the
proper file.
