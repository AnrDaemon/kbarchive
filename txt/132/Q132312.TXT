TITLE   :PRB: Can't Find Grid Property to Specify Record for Top Row
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

You need a grid method or property to tell the grid which row of the
RecordSource to display in the top row of the visible area of a grid. For
example, you might have a 500-record table and a 15-row grid and at run time,
you want to tell the grid to jump to record 430; in other words, you want the
grid to display record 430 in the top row of the visible area of the grid, not
just anywhere in the visible area. A property like the following would work
well:

 - GRID1.FirstRecord = 430

-or-

 - GRID1.DoScroll(1,430)

A filter cannot be used because you want to access all the records in the
RecordSource.

CAUSE
=====

There is no grid property that allows you to specify a row to be displayed as
the first row of the visible area of the grid.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use the RelativeRow property in conjunction with DoScroll method to move
a selected record to the top of the visible area of the grid as in this code:

      thisform.grid1.setfocus
      goto <your recno>
      thisform.refresh

      thisform.lockscreen = .t.
      do while thisform.grid1.relativerow > 1
         thisform.grid1.doscroll(1)
      enddo
      thisform.lockscreen = .f.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
