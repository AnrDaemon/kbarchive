SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95 on a Dell Omniplex 486/66 computer with an ATI Mach32
motherboard display adapter and an NCR SCSI adapter, you may experience one or
more of the following symptoms:

 - The computer restarts, or the mouse pointer breaks up into pieces and then
   the computer stops responding (hangs) when you select a high-color background
   bitmap.

 - The computer hangs when you start a program. The display may also be garbled
   when this occurs.

 - The computer hangs with a garbled display when you are copying files.

number A04. The problem appears to be a conflict between the Mach32 display
adapter and the NCR SCSI adapter.
