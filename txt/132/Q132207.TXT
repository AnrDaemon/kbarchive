TITLE   :PRB: MSINFO Not Installed on Windows NT or Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Visual FoxPro version 3.0 on Windows NT or Windows 95, you
notice that MSINFO is not installed by the Complete configuration option.


CAUSE
=====

MSINFO is a Microsoft Technical Support application designed to gather system
configuration information from customers. This information can assist a
technical support professional to more quickly identify the cause of a
customer's problem. The current version of MSINFO writes information about
itself to the WIN.INI file when it is installed.

Windows 95 logo requirements specify that applications use the registry and not
the Win.ini or System.ini files to store application information. This ensures
that applications are properly registered and visible in the Windows 95
environment. To meet these logo requirements, Visual FoxPro's default (Complete)
installation does not include MSINFO under Windows NT or Windows 95, which are
both 32-bit environments.

NOTE: MSINFO is included in the complete installation of Visual FoxPro version
3.0 under Windows version 3.1x and Windows for Workgroups version 3.11.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
