The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the purpose, installation, and operation of versions 3.0
and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks utility PABSYNC.DLL that is included
in the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Resource Kit.

Notes:

 - Until you fully understand the use of this program and as a precaution,
   backup your mail message file (MMF) file.

 - You should use the utility with caution. While the program is useful in
   synchronizing many of the Personal Address Book (PAB) inconsistencies with
   the global address list (GAL), it is NOT effective in all situations.

   For example, in a situation where you OK a change that will result in
   duplicate entries in the PAB (both the friendly name and the address are the
   same), the corrected entry will become unusable until the program is
   restarted.

 - Because of the duplicate entries, you will also notice that the attempted
   correction has not taken place. You should carefully review the changes
   suggested by the program before accepting them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PABSync is a Microsoft Mail custom command that allows you to not only scan your
PAB for inconsistencies, but also to interactively correct these
inconsistencies.

Installation
------------

PABSync consists of one dynamic-link library (DLL). This DLL, named PABSYNC.DLL,
is installed into the Windows System directory. A new custom command entry is
required in the MSMAIL.INI file located in the Windows directory. This line
should look similar to the following:

   PBS=3.0;File;P&AB Sync...;13;PABSYNC.DLL;2;;Synchronizes
   personal addressbook;MSMAIL.HLP;2870

Please refer to the Microsoft Mail documentation for additional information on
installation of custom commands.

Operation
---------

After PABSync is installed as a custom command, you can run it when Microsoft
Mail for Windows is running. In order to use the utility, from the File menu,
choose PAB Sync.

PABSync will display a dialog box that asks you for the following:

 - whether you want to check your PAB for duplicate entries,

 - whether you want to check your PAB for inconsistencies against the GAL,

 - whether you want PABSync to automatically make corrections.

NOTE: The automatic update of the PAB is disabled by default. Your input with
this utility is desirable, and the automatic update feature should only be used
if you fully understand its implications.

Manual Update
-------------

After you check which types of synchronization you would like, PABSync proceeds
to check for inconsistencies using the same method as the utility PABCheck
(shipped with version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

When you check for duplicate entries in the PAB, if one is found, a dialog box
prompts you for confirmation of deletion of the duplicate entry. Then, you can
select to either delete the duplicate entry or to ignore it. After you make your
selection, the synchronization continues.

When you check for invalid addresses, you can do two separate actions. If an
entry is found that no longer matches the entry in the GAL (that is, the GAL has
been updated and the PAB entry does not match the GAL entry), you are prompted
with information about the updated entry and whether you would like to update
your PAB. If you select to update your PAB, the synchronization continues.

If you select to not update your PAB, then a second dialog box will prompt you
for confirmation of deletion of the entry. You can either confirm the deletion
or cancel it, and the synchronization will continue.

Automatic Update
----------------

If in the initial selections menu you check for automatic updates, the PABSync
utility will operate without prompting you for confirmation of any
synchronization. Duplicate entries in the PAB will automatically be removed, and
unsynchronized entries in the PAB with regard to the GAL will automatically be
synchronized.

During its operation, PABSync will log any inconsistencies that it finds and any
transactions that occur. At the completion of the check and synchronization, the
log will be placed into your Inbox in the form of a mail message. This operation
is similar to that of PABCheck.

Features such as automatic update of database or list entries can have their
drawbacks, and PABSync's automatic synchronization features are no exception.
Duplicate entries should not exist in the PAB. However, due to a limitation in
the original versions of Mail for Windows (versions 3.0 and 3.2), it was
possible to have duplicate entries added to a PAB. This has been corrected in
maintenance releases. If the older client is being used, PABSync can be useful
in detecting and correcting these duplicate entries. One-offs in the PAB are
ignored as they are a feature that allows you to have entries without links to
the GAL.

Because it may be impossible to determine necessary information about the entry
that will be updated, the inconsistencies between the PAB and GAL should be
corrected manually. For example, if you have an entry with the friendly name
John Doe in your PAB, John Doe leaves the company, and a new John Doe joins the
company, an automatic resync will now have your PAB entry pointing to the new
John Doe. If the user does not realize this, it will cause misdirected mail.

Networks Resource Kit.
