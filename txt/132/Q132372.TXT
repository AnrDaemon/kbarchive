======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to print from Creative Writer to a non-color printer, such as the
Epson LQ-570, using the Epson LQ-2550 printer driver, patterns created using the
Creative Writer Word Shape Tool may not be printed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate steps for your operating system:

Windows 95/98
-------------

If you use the Epson LQ-2550 driver provided with Windows 95 or 98, the patterns
are printed correctly; however, if you are using the older Epson driver provided
with Microsoft Windows 3.x in Microsoft Windows 95 or 98, follow the steps for
Windows 3.x listed below to resolve the problem.

Windows 3.x
-----------

1. In Creative Writer, press CTRL+SHIFT+A, and then click OK. The Creative
   Writer Control Room floating menu bar appears on the screen.

2. On the File menu, click Printing Options.

3. Click Set Local.

4. Click Setup, and then click Options.

5. Click the Color check box to clear it, and then click OK.

6. Click OK twice to return to the Creative Writer Control Room floating menu
   bar.

7. On the File menu, click Return To Creative Writer.

Patterns you create using the Word Shape Tool should now be printed
successfully.
