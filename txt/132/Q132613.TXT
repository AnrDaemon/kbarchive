======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On an EISA computer, you may see any of the following symptoms:

 - Windows 95 or programs running in Windows 95 fail to start. Error messages
   indicating that the problem is related to memory may or may not be displayed.

 - Different programs report different values for installed memory.

 - At startup, Himem.sys reports that bad memory is installed on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

The CMOS in the EISA computer contains incorrect information about the amount of
RAM that is installed. Windows 95 queries the EISA CMOS directly to find out how
much RAM is installed on the computer and then uses that information to locate
and use the installed RAM. If the amount of installed RAM reported by the CMOS
is incorrect, Windows 95 may become unstable, leading to the symptoms described
above.

These problems do not appear to be dependent on the amount of RAM that is
installed on the computer, although the problems may occur more frequently or be
more pronounced on computers with more than 16 MB of installed RAM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the CMOS on the computer contains accurate information about the
amount of RAM installed. For more information about how to do so, contact your
computer manufacturer.

If you are unable to access the CMOS in the computer, or if you are unable to
find out if the symptoms you are experiencing are being caused by an incorrect
EISA memory configuration, add the following line to the Config.sys file:

   DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS /NOEISA
