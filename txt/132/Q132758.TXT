TITLE   :Netware Client Cannot Create A File
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access a directory on a Windows 95 NetWare-compatible peer server, you
are unable to create a file in a directory where the NetWare or compatible
client has create permissions and no write permissions.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the CreateFile request expects a file handle to be
returned that cannot be written to or read from. The underlying operating system
on the server (Windows 95) does not support this type of network request.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, give the user write permissions to the directory, as
well as create permissions.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Networking programs sometimes attempt to use file creation and existence as a
method of serialization (copy-protection). This problem may occur with such
programs. If you have a program that requires this serialization technique and
also requires secure access to files in the same directory, you should move the
program to a true NetWare server.
