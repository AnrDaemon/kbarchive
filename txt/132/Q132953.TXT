SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Integrity Check utility, included with the Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks Resource Kit, allows you to copy the error list to the Clipboard.
Then it can be pasted into another application to be saved or printed.

When you copy the error list to the Clipboard, the first error is truncated. As a
result, it is not viewable in the Clipboard or when pasted into the destination
application.

MORE INFORMATION

option or by selecting Copy Error List to Clipboard from the File menu.
