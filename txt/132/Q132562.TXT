TITLE   :PC WRmt: Server with Net Name MSG Won't Download Address List
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the server you are dialing in to has the network name of MSG, the Mail Remote
for Windows client will not properly download the address list. Although the
server reports the entire list was sent, the client only receives a 1-byte file.

CAUSE
=====

The network name of MSG is the same as the type name for a message. This
apparently causes the Mail Remote client to believe it is processing a message
and not an address list. As a result, the remote client does not update the
list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

Additional query words: 3.20
