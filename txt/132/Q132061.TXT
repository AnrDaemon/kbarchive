TITLE   :I/O Addresses Not Available with Future Domain 850 Series
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:diskmem win95 kbDiskMemory

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are configuring a Future Domain SCSI controller in Device Manager, you
may not be able to configure the controller to use the E800h-E9FFh or
EA00h-EBFFh I/O address range, even though you can configure the controller
itself to use either of these ranges. This problem is known to occur with the
following Future Domain controllers:

 - TMC-850

 - TMC-850M

 - TMC-850MER

 - TMC-850MEX

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows 95 SCSI.INF file and hardware detection
routine do not distinguish between the Future Domain 850- and 860-series
controllers. Although the 850-series controllers can be configured to use the
I/O addresses listed above, the 860-series controllers cannot.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Future Domain 850-series SCSI controllers cannot be configured to use the
E800h-E9FFh or EA00h-EBFFh I/O address range when you are using the Windows 95
protected-mode drivers. If you are using protected-mode drivers, use one of the
following valid address ranges for the controller:

 - C800h-C9FFh

 - CA00h-CBFFh

 - CE00h-CFFFh

 - DE00h-DFFFh

If you must use the E800h-E9FFh or EA00h-EBFFh I/O address range, use the
real-mode drivers included with the controller instead of the Windows 95
protected-mode drivers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
