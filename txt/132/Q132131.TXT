-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft ODBC 16-bit Database Driver Pack version 2.0 is supported on two
platforms:

 - Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11 (including Windows For Workgroups 3.11)

 - Windows NT versions 3.50 and 3.51

Microsoft ODBC 32-bit Database Driver Pack version 2.0 is supported on two
platforms:

 - Windows NT versions 3.50 and 3.51

 - Windows 95

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft 16-bit Database Drivers include: Microsoft Access, Microsoft
Excel, Paradox, Btrieve, dBase, FoxPro, and text drivers. The Microsoft 32- bit
Database Drivers include: Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Paradox, dBase,
FoxPro, and text drivers.

Information in the Release Notes and the ODBCJET.HLP file that ship with the
Database Driver Pack 2.0 states that the 16-bit drivers are supported on Win32s;
however, that information is incorrect. On Win32s, only the ODBC 2.10 core
components (Driver manager and Thunking DLLs) are supported.

The bug mentioned in Knowledge Base article number Q129772, "BUG:Attempt to load
required component ODBC32.DLL failed," has been fixed in ODBC SDK 2.1b, which
will be released with the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). You can contact
third-party vendors to get 16-bit ODBC drivers tested on Win32s.
