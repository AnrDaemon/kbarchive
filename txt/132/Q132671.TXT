SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document, Windows 95 seems to stop responding (hangs) on some
computers that have 4 MB of RAM (Random Access Memory) and that have multimedia
components installed.


CAUSE
=====

There may not be enough available memory to start the print spooler.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

1. On the desktop, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers on
   the menu that appears.

2. Using the right mouse button, click the Printer icon, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

3. In the Printer Properties dialog box, click the Details tab, and then click
   Port Settings.

4. Make sure the "Spool MS-DOS print jobs" box is not checked, and then click
   OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By using this workaround, some of your documents may print more slowly.
