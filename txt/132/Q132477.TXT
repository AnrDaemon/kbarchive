PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT 3.51 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) states that the 3Com 3C619
TokenLink III Adapter is an ISA network adapter. This information is incomplete.
The 3Com 3C619 TokenLink III Adapter can be configured for either an ISA or EISA
bus. The driver for this adapter, located in the
\DRVLIB\NETCARD\{platform}\TLNK3 on the Windows NT 3.51 CD, only supports EISA
based systems. It is listed in the Add Network Adapter list as a "3Com TokenLink
III EISA Adapter."

If you attempt to install this adapter in an ISA based computer, the following
error message appears:

   Network card is not present in this system.

CAUSE
=====

The current OEMSETUP.INF and OEMNADZZ.INF files contain entries that only allow
this adapter to function in EISA based computers.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
