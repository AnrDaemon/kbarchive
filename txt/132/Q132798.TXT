SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Font Assistant in Windows 95, you see no fonts or only a
few of the fonts installed on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 has moved the installed font list from the [fonts] section of the
Win.ini file to the registry HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\
CurrentVersion\Fonts and moved the font files to the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Fonts folder in Windows 95 to manage your fonts or contact your
third-party Font Manager vendor for a version compatible with Windows 95.

To use the Windows 95 Font Manager, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel on
   the menu that appears.

2. Double-click the Fonts folder.

3. Double-click the Font icon to view that font.
