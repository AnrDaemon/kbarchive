KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia and instruct Setup to restore
the Msacm.dll and Msacm.drv files that it replaced, you may receive the
following error message if you try to start the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia
without first restarting Windows 95:

   GME95 Caused a Segment Load Failure in Module KRNL386.EXE

CAUSE
=====

On many computers, the Msacm.dll file is loaded by Windows 95 by default when it
starts. The Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia Setup program overwrites and then
restores this file while it is resident in memory, causing the copy of the file
that is resident in memory to become unstable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart Windows 95 before running the Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia for the
first time.
