MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the MSRMTCN.DLL file, a replacement for the MSRMTCN.DLL
file that is included with versions 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
This replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original
MSRMTCN.DLL file, correcting the following problems:

 - A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
   book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
   the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
   works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
   DLL:

      MSRMT.DLL   v3.2.4013
      MSRMTSU.DLL v 3.2.4013
      MSRMTTR.DLL v3.2.4013

(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

To update your MSRMTCN.DLL file
-------------------------------

1. Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the current
   driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System
   Selector from the Windows Program Manager, choosing Microsoft Mail Remote,
   and then selecting Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

   " copy <drive>:\msrmtcn.dll <destination> " (without the
   quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive and directory where you ran the self
   extracting MSRMTCN.EXE file and <destination> is the drive and
   directory where your MSRMTCN.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
   ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
   MSRMTCN.DLL is located in the Windows SYSTEM directory on drive C, type the
   following command:

   " copy d:\test\msrmtcn.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
