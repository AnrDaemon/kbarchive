TITLE   :Lotus Programs Have Distorted Buttons on Title Bar
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Close button in the upper-right corner of some Lotus
programs, the icon turns into a Help icon that is not functional. Other
miscellaneous icons or buttons may also appear.

CAUSE
=====

Lotus programs expect a certain layout for the icons on the title bar. Because
of the changes in the Windows 95 interface, these icons are no longer where the
Lotus programs expect them to be.


RESOLUTION
==========

At present, there is no workaround to this behavior; however, this behavior does
not affect the Lotus applications' functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Lotus programs are known to exhibit this behavior:

 - Lotus Approach 3.0

 - Lotus 1-2-3
