TITLE   :Wacom Pen Tablet Does Not Function in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Wacom pen tablet attached to your computer may not function correctly after
you install Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, re-install the software included with the Wacom pen
tablet. For information about other possible resolutions, please contact Wacom.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Wacom pen tablet is the only pointing device installed on the computer
when Windows 95 is installed, the Wacom pen tablet mouse driver (Wacpen.drv) is
not removed from the System.ini file. However, the Wacom pen tablet VxD
(Wacom.386) is renamed to Wacom386.10, and all references to the original driver
name are removed from the System.ini file. The Wacom.drv file is also renamed to
Wacomdrv.10.

The Pen Extensions for Microsoft Windows (Pen Windows) software version 1.0 is
essentially disabled by the installation of Windows 95. You should not attempt
to resolve this problem by configuring the Wacom pen tablet to be Pen
Windows-compatible. The only resolution at this time is to re-install the
software included with the Wacom pen tablet.
