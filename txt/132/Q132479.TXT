TITLE   :PRB: 'Variable 'TYPE' is not found' err msg using Export
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On the File menu, if you click Export to export a Visual FoxPro table to FoxPro
version 2.x format, the following error message displays if the COPY TO command
is more than 254 characters long:

   Variable 'TYPE' is not found

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro's Export dialog box appears to put the string generated from the
COPY TO command into a variable. However, variables can contain up to 254
characters, so the code appears to pull off the last field name from the COPY TO
command. The text displayed in the Command window looks something like this:

COPY TO d:\vfp\ord FIELDS Orders.order_id,Orders.cust_id,Orders.emp_id, ;
Orders.to_name,Orders.to_address,Orders.to_city,Orders.to_region, ;
Orders.postalcode,Orders.to_country,Orders.ship_count,Orders.ship_via, ;
Orders.order_date,Orders.order_amt,Orders.order_dsc,Orders.order_net, ; Orders.
TYPE FOX2X

The last field in the ORDERS table is FREIGHT, and the above code shows how the
last field name is stripped from the COPY TO command.

WORKAROUND
==========

Choose any one of the following workarounds:

 - Type the "COPY TO" (without the quotation marks) command in the Command
   window.

-or-

 - Create and run a program file to use the COPY TO command.

-or-

 - Use the COPY TO command (through the dialog box, in the Command window, or in
   a program file) without typing in the field names when you are exporting all
   field names.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
