SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to use the ADBOBJECTS function in a program to
determine the names of all tables contained within a database container (.DBC
file), and then use the resulting array to open all tables.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following program creates an array (laTableNames) containing the names of
all the tables in the Tastrade.dbc sample database container. The FOR loop then
opens each table in its own work area. The name of each table is displayed in
the upper-right corner of the screen as it is opened.

Code Sample
-----------

   ** Begin Code Example
   CLOSE ALL
   OPEN DATABASE c:\vfp\samples\mainsamp\data\tastrade
   lnNumOfTables = ADBOBJECTS(laTableNames, "Table")
   FOR i = 1 to lnNumOfTables
      WAIT WINDOW "Opening Table " + laTableNames(i) TIMEOUT 2
      USE laTableNames(i) IN 0
   ENDFOR
   SET VIEW ON
   ** End Code Example
