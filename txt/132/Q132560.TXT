The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11 provide a simple, single
postoffice for workgroup connectivity. Usually, this postoffice is installed by
one user via the Workgroups Mail Windows client. This user can then administer
this postoffice via the Microsoft Workgroup Postoffice Manager for Windows
dynamic-link library (DLL)--WGPOMGR.DLL.

Once this postoffice has been upgraded to a standard Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks version 3.0 or 3.2 postoffice, WGPOMGR.DLL will no longer work against
this upgraded postoffice. This article describes, with technical detail, why
WGPOMGR.DLL does not work against a standard postoffice.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When WGPOMGR.DLL initializes, it examines the MASTER.GLB file of the postoffice,
the location of which is indicated by the "ServerPath=" statement in the
[Microsoft Mail] section of the MSMAIL.INI file on that workstation:

   [Microsoft Mail]
   ServerPath=M:\

WGPOMGR.DLL then checks the MASTER.GLB file to see if it is of type "single
postoffice." If the postoffice is a single postoffice, the .DLL file then checks
to ensure the proper template files exist.

If the proper template files exist, WGPOMGR.DLL locks open the FLAG.GLB file and
allows the user (with proper access rights) to administer the WGPO postoffice.

NOTES:

1. A standard Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice will be an
   "internetwork" type postoffice in the MASTER.GLB file. This postoffice type,
   in the MASTER.GLB, allows message transfer agents to transfer mail to and
   from the postoffice.

2. WGPO postoffices all have the same serial number: 0799-99992. Standard
   postoffices each have an individual serial number.

3. The procedure to remove the WGPOMGR.DLL entries from the Windows Client for
   an upgraded postoffice are outlined in the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

   Q91042 PC WFW: Postoffice Administration Not Available from Windows

4. The WGPO postoffice always contains an ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF file set.
   These files hold additional user information. Standard postoffices need not
   necessarily contain ADMIN.TPL and ADMIN.INF files; however, they may have
   these files if they are defined by the administrator.
