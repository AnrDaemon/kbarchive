TITLE   :PRB: Visual Basic DisableAsync Fails w/ MASJT200.DLL
PRODUCT :Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you have both the Visual Basic (VB) compatibility layer and the Microsoft
ODBC Desktop Database Drivers installed, a VB application (EXE) always runs in
asynchronous query execution mode, no matter if DisableAsync is set to one or
zero in the application's initialization file(<app> .INI).

WORKAROUND
==========

Install the Microsoft Access Service Pack, which upgrades the Jet Engine
(MSAJT200.DLL) to version 2.50.1606.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q122927 WX1124: Microsoft Access Version 2.0 Service Pack


A VB application will always run in synchronous query execution mode with this
service pack installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A VB application, which accesses ODBC data sources via Data Access Objects, can
be forced into synchronous query execution mode by specifying the following in
its .INI file:

      [ODBC]
      DisableAsync=1

By default, DisableAsync is set to zero.

When the VB compatibility layer is installed, the Jet Engine is upgraded from
version 1.0 to version 2.0. If the Microsoft ODBC Desktop Database Drivers are
then installed, the Jet Engine (MSAJT200.DLL) will be upgraded to version
2.50.1117, which forces a VB application into asynchronous query execution mode
forever.

Additional query words: 2.00.2317 Windows NT 3.1 3.5
