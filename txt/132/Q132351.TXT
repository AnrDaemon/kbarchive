TITLE   :NE2000 Install Fails with Default Base I/O Address
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5

SUMMARY
=======

If you accept the default configuration when installing the NE2000 network
interface card (NIC), the installation fails.

CAUSE
=====

The NE2000 driver defaults to a base I/0 address of 280h, whereas the NIC itself
defaults to base I/O address 300h.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you install the NE2000 driver, change the base I/O address to 300h. If you
want to use a base I/O address other than 300h, you must run the diagnostics
utility that came with the NE2000 NIC to change its setting.
