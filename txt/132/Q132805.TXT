TITLE   :Tabworks Replaces Windows 95 Shell with Program Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Tabworks in Windows 95 and set it as the shell, and then try to
return to the normal Windows 95 shell, Tabworks sets Program Manager as the
shell.

CAUSE
=====

Tabworks changes the "shell=" line in the System.ini file. The normal shell for
Windows 95 is Explorer.exe, but Tabworks set the shell to Progman.exe.

RESOLUTION
==========

To return to the normal Windows 95 shell, use any text editor (such as Notepad)
to edit the System.ini file. Modify the "shell=" line so that it reads:

   shell=explorer.exe

After you make this change, save and then close the file, and then restart
Windows 95.
