TITLE   :Setup Disks Created With WINNT /O Fail To Find Hard Disk
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Setup disks created with the WINNT /O or WINNT32 /O command or when
you run the gui mode WINNT command, select options, and select create boot
floppy disk, Windows NT Setup fails and the following error message appears:

   Setup is unable to locate the hard drive partition prepared by the MS-DOS
   portion of Setup.

   When you run the MS-DOS Windows NT Setup program, you must specify a temporary
   drive that is supported by Windows NT. See your System Guide for more
   information.

CAUSE
=====

The WINNT /O or WINNT32 /O command creates three Windows NT Setup disks and a
file called WINNT.SIF (on Disk 2) for Windows NT Setup. The WINNT.SIF file
contains information about the location of Temporary files copied your hard disk
drive. If the temporary NT installation files are not accessible or missing the
above message will be displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete or rename the WINNT.SIF file on Disk 2 or
remake the setup disks using WINNT /OX or WINNT32 /OX and restart Windows NT
Setup.
