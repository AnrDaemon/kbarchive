SUMMARY
=======

A dialog box prompts the user to enter a value for the parameter if you use a
parameterized view stored in the data environment of a form and the parameter
wasn't initialized before the form was opened. The dialog box pops up when the
view opens. To prevent this from happening, you must specify an initial value
for the parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set the initial value of the parameter, and prevent the dialog box from
appearing. In the BeforeOpenTables event of the data environment, declare the
parameter as Public, and give it an initial value. For example:

      Public Myparam
      Myparam = "Initial Value"

Using this method ensures that there is an initial value for the parameter as the
view is opened, so the dialog box doesn't appear.
