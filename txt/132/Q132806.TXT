TITLE   :Persistent Connections Not Preserved on Upgrade
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade to Windows 95 and the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks
from the Microsoft LAN Manager 2.2 client, persistent connections are no longer
made at startup.

CAUSE
=====

Persistent connections in LAN Manager 2.2 are stored in a format not recognized
by Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make a note of all persistent connections before you upgrade, or view the
contents of the Lmuser.ini file after setup. After you upgrade, re- establish
these connections manually and check the Reconnect At Logon check box to make
the connections persistent.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 95. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
