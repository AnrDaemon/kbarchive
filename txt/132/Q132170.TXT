TITLE   :NET VIEW to LAN Manager for UNIX Server Fails from Windows NT
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A NET VIEW command issued from a Windows NT Workstation against a Hewlett-
Packard LAN Manager for UNIX version 1.4x server fails with an access denied
error.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT Workstation issues an OPEN and X Server Message Block (SMB) for
\PIPE\SRVSVC, the LAN Manager for UNIX server returns an ERRbadaccess ( 1,12).
This error prevents Windows NT from sending a NetServerEnum Api via Transact SMB
to the LAN Manager for UNIX server.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around by using the utility, NETVIEWX.EXE which lists file shares
on a LAN Manager for UNIX server. Call Microsoft Product Support Services to get
this utility.


STATUS
======

Hewlett-Packard is aware of this problem. We will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
