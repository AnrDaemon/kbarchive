======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When an application calls DISPLAY API (included in the SNA Server APPC
Management Verb support) that application receives

   DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT.

The SNA Server APPC interface returns DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT if you do NOT set
following values.

                   NS/2     IBM EE    NS/2 format        EE format
                   format   format (Windows NT only)  (Windows NT only)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   init_sect_len    50         44         52                 48
   num_sections     16          9         16                  9

DISPLAY_INVALID_CONSTANT is also returned when you do not set the following
values:

   reserv2 : NULL
   am_info : AP_NO
   tp_info : AP_NO
   adapter_info : AP_NO (if NS/2 format)
   ms_info : AP_NO (if NS/2 format)

Also, for the DISPLAY verb to work, a specific connection must be defined in the
SNA Server Admin program Display Verb dialog box. IBM originally defined the
DISPLAY verb with the IBM OS/2 Extended Edition product which assumed a single
connection. However, because SNA Server supports multiple connections, the
specific connection associated with the DISPLAY verb must be configured.
