TITLE   :Shortcut to Network Drive Does Not Work
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using a shortcut to a network drive repeatedly may cause the shortcut to fail
with the following error message:

   The drive or network connection that the shortcut refers to is unavailable.
   Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is
   available, and then try again.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Network client maintains a list of the last eight network
connections. When you try to use the shortcut to create a new link, the oldest
of the eight previous connections is removed. However, the new connection is the
same as the previous eight connections, so the connection that was just created
is removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can restart Windows 95 to correct the problem, or you can map the network
drive manually. To map the network drive, use the following steps:

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Map Network Drive.

3. In the Drive box, click the drive letter you want for the connection.

4. In the Path box, enter the path for the network connection.

5. Click OK.
