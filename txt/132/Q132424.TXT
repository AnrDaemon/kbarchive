SUMMARY
=======

In previous versions of Microsoft Windows you can remove TrueType fonts without
deleting the font files. When you remove a TrueType font in Windows 95, the font
file is deleted from the hard disk. This article describes how to remove a
TrueType font in Windows 95 without deleting the font file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove TrueType fonts without deleting the font files you must maintain two
copies of each font file on the hard disk. The fonts in the \Fonts folder are
the installed fonts, while the fonts in the other folder are available for
installation but may not be active.

Follow these steps to remove a font without deleting the font file:

1. Use Windows Explorer to create a folder to store a copy of the TrueType font
   files.

2. Copy the fonts you want to remove from the Windows\Fonts folder to the folder
   you created in step 1.

3. Use the Fonts tool in Control Panel to remove the TrueType fonts.

If you decide to re-install a font that you have removed, you can install the
font from the folder containing the font file copies. Make sure to select the
"Copy fonts to the Fonts folder" option so that the font file is copied. If you
do not select this option, the font file is located in only one folder and is
deleted the next time you remove the font.
