======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the MS-DOS-based program BloodNet, the program may not
product digital sound on a Pro Audio Spectrum 16 sound card.

CAUSE
=====

BloodNet tries to reconfigure the sound card to use high DMA channel 7. To
maintain system stability, the device driver for the card prevents this
reconfiguration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any one of the following methods:

 - Use Sound Blaster-compatible mode for digital audio.

 - Reconfigure the sound card to use high DMA channel 7.

 - Configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode.
