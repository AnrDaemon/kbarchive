SUMMARY
=======

This article lists known issues concerning chat sessions on The Microsoft
Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ignore Does Not Toggle
----------------------

This problem occurs only when you are the first member in the Member List pane.
If you select all the people in the Member List pane, including yourself, and
click Ignore, everyone except you is ignored. If you click Ignore again, nothing
happens. Clicking Ignore should toggle the status of the people who are
selected.


Messages Do Not Appear with Member Properties Open
--------------------------------------------------

When you open a member's properties, messages stop appearing in the Chat History
pane while the member's properties are open.


Two Types of Chat
-----------------

If you look at the properties for a chat session, the type may be shown as either
"Chat" or "Chat Room." There is no difference between the two.


Selected Text in Two Panes
--------------------------

If you select (or highlight) text in the Chat History pane, then select text in
the Compose pane, the text in the Chat History pane remains selected. If you use
an edit command (such as Copy), the command works on the selected text in the
Compose pane.


Keyboard Command for Select All Does Not Work
---------------------------------------------

If you place the insertion point in the Member List pane and press CTRL+A,
everyone is not selected as you expect. To work around this problem, use the
Select All command on the Edit menu.


Clearing History Causes Bold Text
---------------------------------

If you enter a chat room that displays a message stating that you have joined the
chat session, select the text in that message, and click Clear History, all the
subsequent text you type is displayed in bold.


Toolbar Button Problem When Changing Color Scheme
-------------------------------------------------

If you change the Windows 95 color scheme while you have a chat session open, the
toolbar buttons that are disabled appear as blank boxes.
