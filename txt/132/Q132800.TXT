======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Rebel Assault 1.4 (or other programs), you may receive the
following error message:

   DOS/16M error: [31] protected mode already in use in this DPMI virtual
   machine

CAUSE
=====

The MS-DOS extender used by this program is not compatible with Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

For Rebel Assault 1.4, you can work around this problem by using the Rebel2.bat
file, instead of the Rebel.exe file, to start the program. Do not use the
Rebel.exe file or the Reb.bat file.

For other programs with the same problem, use the following steps to configure
the program to run in MS-DOS mode:

1. Use the right mouse button to click the program icon, and then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

4. Click the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option button.

5. Click OK to close all the opened dialog boxes.

Additional modifications may be necessary if the program requires expanded memory
(EMM386) or a CD-ROM drive; follow standard procedures for MS-DOS- mode programs
to make such services available.

To start the program, double-click its icon, or type its name in the Run dialog
box. Do not type the program's name at an MS-DOS prompt to start it; doing so
does not use the new configuration.
