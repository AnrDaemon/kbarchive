TITLE   :Custom Scaling Not Applied By TEXT Data Type with PostScript
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can set the default scaling factor for jobs sent to a PostScript printer by
running Print Manager, selecting Properties from the Printer menu, choosing
Details, choosing Job Defaults, then choosing Options. This scaling works
correctly in Windows-based applications such as Microsoft Word for Windows.
However, if you copy a text file to such a printer from an MS-DOS Command
Prompt, and the Default Datatype for that printer is set to TEXT, any changes
you make to the default scaling factor are not reflected in the print job.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT PostScript printer driver does not set the scaling factor
correctly for text jobs with the TEXT data type. The driver sets the scaling
factor correctly for jobs with other data types (such as those sent by
Windows-based applications) and other drivers that support scaling factors (such
as the HP-GL/2 plotter driver).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a non-PostScript printer driver which supports
a scaling factor.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
