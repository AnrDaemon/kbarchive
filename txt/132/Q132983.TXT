 - You are using user profiles and have disabled the ability to edit registry
   settings.

To correct the problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Check for multiple copies of the Regedit.exe file on the hard disk. If you
   find multiple copies, remove all but the latest version of the file. The
   Regedit.exe file should be located in the Windows folder with a size of
   120,320 bytes and a date of 07-11-95 9:50 AM.

 - Temporarily disable user profiles. To do so, follow these steps:

   1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

   2. Double-click the Passwords icon.

   3. On the User Profiles tab, click the "All users of this computer use the
      same preferences and desktop settings" option button.

   4. Click OK.
