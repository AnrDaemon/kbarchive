PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbsmsAdmin smsadmin

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Disk information in Systems Management Server Administrator Personal
Computer Properties incorrectly reports the amount of Free Storage and Storage
Size on NetWare volumes larger than two gigabytes (GB).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.0. This problem was corrected in Systems Management Server version
1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This may adversely affect the distribution of packages to NetWare servers if the
compressed package being distributed is larger than the available storage space
Systems Management Server sees. Therefore, ensure your NetWare distribution
servers each have sufficient storage space prior to distributing any packages.
