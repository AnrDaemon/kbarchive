SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of Borland C++ version 4.5, the Install program stops
responding (hangs) when you choose to read the Readme file.

CAUSE
=====

Borland C++ is waiting for the 16-bit program called Notepad to close, but in
both Windows 95 and Windows NT, Notepad.exe is a 32-bit program. This causes the
Install program to hang.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not open the Readme file.

-or-

Request an updated version of the Readme file from Borland International, Inc.
