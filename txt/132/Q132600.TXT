SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running The Lion King version 1.0, the animations do not play
correctly. Parts of the characters are not drawn in some frames, making portions
of the characters seem to disappear briefly.

Windows 95 handles the timing of animation playback differently than Windows
3.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to The Lion King version 1.1.
