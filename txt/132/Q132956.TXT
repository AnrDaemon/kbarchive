TITLE   :PC WRmt: Run w/ Megahertz EM114t Modem/Ethernet PCMCIA Card
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows with a Megahertz EM114t
modem/ethernet PCMCIA card, you must either modify the CONFIG.SYS file to run
the "card services" properly, or run the point enabler, SETEM.EXE, on the
Megahertz Installation Diskette, if card & socket services are not installed
on the computer.

If you do not make these changes or use the point enabler, the machine will
produce error messages stating that the modem can not be found.

RESOLUTION
==========

Procedure A: Modifying the Card Services Settings
-------------------------------------------------

The modifications to the "card services" in the CONFIG.SYS are:

   DEVICE=C:\EM\SSCIRRUS.EXE /ada=0 /skt=2
   DEVICE=C:\EM\CS.EXE /irq=b
   DEVICE=C:\EM\CSALLOC.EXE C:\CSALLOC.INI
   DEVICE=C:\EM\CARDID.EXE

NOTE: The above modifications are to be made after you run the Megahertz
auto-install.

Procedure B: Running the Point Enabler
--------------------------------------

The following switches can be used when you execute SETEM.EXE:

 Switch                  Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------

 /sa or /sb              Socket placement (/sa=upper or /sb=lower)
 /c2                     COM port setting (/c2=com2)
 /i5                     Interrupt setting (/i5=interrupt 5)
 /bnnn                   Port or I/O Base for ethernet board
 /pnnnn                  Start of memory range exclusion for the card.
 /dnnnn                  Delay in milliseconds that the driver waits to
                         initialize the card.
 /m                      Modem only. This option disables the network
                         functions of the card.

Using the above options, a line must be placed in either the CONFIG.SYS or the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file before the network device drivers. For example:

CONFIG.SYS:

   DEVICE=C:\SETEM.EXE /sa /c2 /i5 /b300 /pd000

-or-

AUTOEXEC.BAT:

   SETEM.EXE /sa /c2 /i5 /b300 /pd000

Notes:

 - The examples above are the defaults mentioned in the Megahertz Ethernet-Modem
   "User Reference Guide".

 - The point enabler will disable "hot swapping," or the ability to change
   PCMCIA cards without rebooting the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information on configuring the Megahertz PCMCIA Ethernet-Modem card,
EM1144-T, refer to Chapter Two - Installation of the Megahertz Ethernet-Modem
"User Reference Guide," included with the EM1144-T PCMCIA card.

This information has been verified with Megahertz technical support.

Microsoft will support the use of the USGNERIC.SCR, with most Megahertz modems
(PCMCIA or "pocket"), if configured properly, successful connections can be made
at a maximum rate of 2400 baud.

On the Megahertz BBS and on the Megahertz library of the Modem Vendors forum of
CompuServe,(GO MEGAHERTZ), the file MHSDRIVE.EXE should be downloaded. There are
many scripts included in this file, the one that gives optimal performance is
XJ144REL.SCR. T3144REL.SCR will also work well.
