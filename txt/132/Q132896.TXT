TITLE   :FTP Client Scripts Terminate Without Completing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

FTP Client scripts appear to terminate early without performing any work.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT FTP client (FTP.EXE) script handler does not wait for a final
response before issuing additional commands when a command is responded to by
multiple Multi-Line Responses ("xyz-"). Per RFC959, Multi- Line Responses should
be bracketed by prefixing only the first and last line with "xyz-" and
"xyz<SP>" respectively. The script handler buffers the multiple "xys-"
responses to satisfy its requests until it receives a QUIT (which terminates the
session).


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the fix mentioned below. The FTP Client was
enhanced to accept multiple Multi-Line Responses.

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already done
so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
