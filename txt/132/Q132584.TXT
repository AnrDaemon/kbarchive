KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run hardware detection in Windows 95 on a computer that is configured
for a LANtastic network, your computer locks up.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 cannot perform safe detection on a computer with LANtastic drivers
running. Unsafe detection on network cards can make a computer lock up.


RESOLUTION
==========

Run Windows 95 Setup again and select the Safe Recovery option. After Setup is
finished, make sure the IRQ for the network card is detected correctly by
starting Device Manager and checking the properties of the network card on the
Resources tab. If the IRQ is not correct, you need to select the correct IRQ
manually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LANtastic network is manufactured by Artisoft, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
