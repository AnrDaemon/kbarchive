SYMPTOMS
========

When a client disconnects from a RAS server, the DTR line on the Digiboard COM
port may not return. Because the modem is not reset, no additional calls can
come in on that port. If a client attempts to dial in, the modem picks up the
line, but the RAS server does not respond. As a result, the client receive a 640
error message. The RAS server does not log any errors in the event log, but the
RAS Administrators tool show that the port has been disconnected and is not
ready.

These symptoms will appear only after the RAS server has been in operation for
some time. Stress tests indicate that several hundred inbound calls are needed
to produce the problem.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem in the Digiboard DIGIFEP5.SYS driver.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Windows NT version 3.5.
