======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a Windows 95 Server-Based Setup (SBS) computer, you may be
prompted twice for a network logon.

NOTE: A Server-Based Setup computer is a computer that is running Windows 95 from
files that exist on a network server.

CAUSE
=====

On an SBS computer, the NET LOGON command is added to the Autoexec.bat file
during Windows 95 Setup. If a NET LOGON command already exists in the
Autoexec.bat file, the command is not overwritten, resulting in two NET LOGON
commands.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use a text editor, such as Notepad, to remove one of the NET LOGON commands from
the Autoexec.Bat file.
