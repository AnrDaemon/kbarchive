SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail spooler icon is displayed on the desktop whenever a Messaging
Application Program Interface (MAPI) application initiates a Mail session.
Simple MAPI does not have a method to hide or remove this icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

However, you can hide the mail spooler icon by invoking Microsoft Windows
Application Programming Interface (API) calls. The following Microsoft Visual
Basic version 3.0 code fragment illustrates how these calls can be used to hide
the Mail spooler after a successful Mail session has been established using
MAPILogon:

      ' Start routine to hide the mail spooler
      Handle% = FindWindow(0&, "MS Mail Spooler (auto)")
      If Handle% <> 0 Then
         Status = ShowWindow(Handle%, SW_HIDE)
      End If
      ' End routine

NOTE: On slower machines, the Mail spooler icon may flash when the above calls
are implemented.
