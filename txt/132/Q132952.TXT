The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) from MS- DOS,
the mail administrator can access the utility without being prompted for a
password.

CAUSE
=====

The password for the user ADMIN was changed to a blank password (no characters).

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the password for the ADMIN account from a blank password. There are two
procedures to do this:

Procedure A
-----------

Run ADMIN.EXE. From the Local-Admin/Recover options, select the Administrator
account (ADMIN), and recover the account using the global password.

Procedure B
-----------

1. Run MAIL.EXE, the MS-DOS mail client, through the Options/Password option,
   type in the old password (for a blank password, press the ENTER key).

2. Type in the new password. Press ENTER. To confirm the password, type in the
   new password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With a blank password, the command line of:

   ADMIN.EXE ADMIN -D<drive>

is sufficient to gain access to the Administrator's program. For security
purposes, it is recommended you have a password for the ADMIN account.
