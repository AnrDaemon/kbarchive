SUMMARY
=======

Controls placed in a dialog box under Windows 95 have a 3D border. If you want
to create a control at run time that has a 3D border, specify the
WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE extended style.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new extended-window style WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE specifies that a window is to
have a 3D border. All controls created by the dialog manager are created with
that style automatically added. To create a control at run time that has a 3D
border, you have to add that style yourself.

Because WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE is an extended style, you cannot use the Create() member
function to create a control. You must call CreateEx(), and pass the appropriate
Windows class name as well. For example, to create an edit control at run time,
you could use this code:

      m_Edit.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_BORDER | WS_VISIBLE,
                    CRect(10,10,100,100),pParent,nID);

Here m_Edit is a CEdit object, pParent is a pointer to a parent window, and nID
is an ID of an edit control. To add a 3D border, create control by using this
code:

      m_Edit.CreateEx(WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE,"EDIT","",
                      WS_CHILD | WS_BORDER | WS_VISIBLE,
                      10,10,100,100,pParent->GetSafeHwnd(),(HMENU)nID);

NOTE: While Visual C++ versions 2.2 and above define WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE in
WINUSER.H, Visual C++ version 2.1 does not. Therefore, if you're using version
2.1, you must include the following definition in your code:

      #define WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE        0x00000200L

If you're using Visual C++ versions 2.2 and above, the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE constant
is automatically defined when you include AFXWIN.H, so no additional work is
necessary.

Keep in mind that the WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE style applies to any window, not just
controls. In Visual C++ versions 2.2 and above, MFC automatically adds
WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE for frames and views but not for CWnd-based windows or
controls.

To create other standard controls, you have to specify their pre-defined Windows
class name: BUTTON, COMBOBOX, LISTBOX, SCROLLBAR, or STATIC.
