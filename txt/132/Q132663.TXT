TITLE   :Windows 95 Hangs When You Start It Again After Setup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) when you start Windows 95 for a second
time after you have completed Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you manually add a SCSI adapter to the system using the
Add New Hardware Wizard if the resource settings for that adapter are not set to
the correct values in Device Manager. When you run Setup again, Windows 95 skips
the detection of the incorrect resources because it detects that a card is
already installed with the actual resources it is using.

This results in two entries for the same SCSI controller (that is, one with the
correct resource settings, and the other with incorrect resource settings). When
Windows 95 attempts to load the SCSI drivers for the card with the incorrect
resource settings, the computer hangs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, start Windows 95 in safe mode and remove the incorrect
SCSI adapter entry. You can safely remove both entries. Then, after you start
Windows 95 in normal mode, the detection option from the Add New Hardware Wizard
detects the SCSI adapter and sets it up using the correct resources.
