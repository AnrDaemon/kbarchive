SUMMARY
=======

The Iomega SCSI ZIP drives operates properly with most SCSI adapters listed in
the Windows NT Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). Windows NT recognizes the ZIP
drive as a removable media drive. Iomega does not provide any Windows NT drivers
for Iomega SCSI drives; however, Iomega does have a Windows NT 3.51/4.0 driver
available for its Jaz Jet Dual PCI SCSI controller card located on the Iomega
WWW site at http://www.iomega.com.

The Iomega ZIP 100 data cartridge can hold up to 96 MB of data. The data
cartridge comes preformatted for either IBM-compatible or Macintosh computers.
You cannot re-format the pre-formatted cartridge for Macintosh computers for
IBM-compatible computers without using either the Iomega ZipTools softare or a
low-level formatting utility provided by the SCSI controller BIOS. The software
is available for MS-DOS and Windows. The Iomega ZipTools software for Windows
does not run under Windows NT.

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
