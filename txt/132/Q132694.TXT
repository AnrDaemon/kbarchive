TITLE   :Windows NT May Hang With DEC Pathworks Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.50 3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT servers with two or more CPUs and DEC Pathworks for Windows NT,
versions 4.1 or 4.1b installed, stop responding (hang). No STOP message appears,
and there no hardware or software errors are logged.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because DEC Pathworks for Windows NT acquires and releases
spinlocks in reverse order in the NetBIOS over DECNet code. This causes the
computer to hang when one CPU tries to acquire a lock still held by another CPU.
The following is a simplified description of how this condition occurs:

1. On Processor 0, a DEC Pathworks for Windows NT routine acquires Lock A
   spinlock, and then, while holding Lock A, tries to acquire Lock B spinlock.

2. On Processor 1, a DEC Pathworks for Windows NT routine acquires Lock B
   spinlock, and then, while holding Lock B, tries to acquire Lock A spinlock.

STATUS
======

DEC Pathworks is currently testing a fix for this problem.
