======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Adobe Illustrator versions 4.0 or 4.03 to an HP printer in
PCL mode with EMF spooling enabled, you may received a general protection fault.

CAUSE
=====

The original entry for Adobe Illustrator is never seen by the Unidrv.dll file;
therefore, Adobe Illustrator incorrectly prints in vector mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Disable EMF spooling for the HP printer when printing from Adobe Illustrator
   4.0 or 4.03.

-or-

 - In the [Compatibility] section of the Win.ini file, change the line that
   reads

   ILLUSTRATOR=0x8000

   so that it reads:

   ILLUSTRA=0x40008000

   Note that the module name is truncated from ILLUSTRATOR in the original line
   to ILLUSTRA in the new line.
