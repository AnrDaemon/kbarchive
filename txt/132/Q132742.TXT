SUMMARY
=======

When you view compressed files on a Microsoft Windows NT version 3.51 server
volume from either File Manager or the Command Prompt, the file size displayed
is the uncompressed size of the file. This is the size that should be used to
check the file for possible corruption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File Manager displays compressed files and directories with blue text.

COMPACT.EXE is a file compression utility shipped with Microsoft Windows NT
version 3.51. It compresses files only on a NTFS partition.

To view the compressed size of the file, you must select the file in File
Manager. Then from the File menu, choose Properties.

Any user that has at least Read and Write permission can use File Manager or
COMPACT.EXE to compress and uncompress files and directories on a NTFS
partition.
