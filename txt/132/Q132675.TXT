SYMPTOMS
========

The compiler generates the following error message when you try to define a
handler for WM_INITDIALOG for your CFormView-derived class using ClassWizard:

   Error C2039: 'OnInitDialog': is not a member of CFormView

CAUSE
=====

This error is a result of the way ClassWizard views CFormView. ClassWizard, in
most respects, treats the CFormView class as a CDialog class, and incorrectly
allows users to define a handler for the WM_INITDIALOG message. If users choose
to have their CFormView derived class handle the WM_INITDIALOG message,
ClassWizard generates an OnInitDialog member function for their
CFormView-derived class. The ClassWizard added OnInitDialog member function
calls the parent OnInitDialog member function as follows:

      CFormView::OnInitDialog();

During compilation, the OnInitDialog member function generates the above
mentioned error because CFormView is neither derived from CDialog nor does it
have an OnInitDialog member function defined in its class.

RESOLUTION
==========

To perform initialization of your CFormView, either override the OnInitialUpdate
member function or define a handler for the WM_CREATE message in the
CFormView-derived class.
