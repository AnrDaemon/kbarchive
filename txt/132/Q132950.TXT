TITLE   :Event ID 3216 and 3208 Logged For Replicator Service
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5 3.51 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you replicate logon scripts using the Replicator service in Windows NT,
although the replication occurs, the following events appear in the Event Viewer
system log:

   Event ID: 3216
   Source: Replicator
   Type: Error
   Description: System Error 32 occurred.

   Event ID: 3208
   Source: Replicator
   Type: Error
   Description: The replication service could not update Directory
   Scripts from the source on Computer_name due to error 32.


If you have alerts configured, the following error messages may appear:

   The replication service could not update directory Scripts from the Source on
   <computer_name> due to error 32.

   Replicated data has changed in Directory Scripts.

CAUSE
=====

The replicator service requires exclusive use of resources, such as directories
and all of their subdirectories being imported or exported, and files on the
REPL$ and NETLOGON shares. Any violation of this exclusive use, such as File
Manager having one of these directories open, or users connected to the NETLOGON
share, causes this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some things you can do to minimize these nuisance messages are:

 - Make sure nothing on the export server is keeping the REPL\EXPORT directory
   or subdirectories open.

 - If user logon scripts are being used, make sure the client fully exits the
   batch file and doesn't keep it open.

 - Make sure there are no persistent connections established to the NETLOGON
   share from any clients.

 - Tune the replication service to replicate at longer intervals - see
   associated article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS

and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
