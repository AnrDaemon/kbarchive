TITLE   :TEXT "Datatype" Does Not Interpret Form-Feed Correctly
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.10 3.50
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a text-only print job that is assigned the TEXT data type to a
Windows NT printer, and that job contains form-feed characters (0x0C), the
form-feed characters are not converted into form-feed commands in the final
output.

For example, if the job contains "test1<ff>test2" (without the quotation
marks), where the <ff> represents a form-feed character, and the job's
data type is TEXT, the WINPRINT print processor should create a new print job
that prints test1 on one page and test2 on a second page. Instead, test1and
test2 are printer on the same page with a symbol representing the form-feed
character between those strings.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT version 3.1 and 3.5 WINPRINT print processor attempts to print
the character rather than interpreting it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1 and 3.5.
This problem was corrected in Windows NT 3.51.
