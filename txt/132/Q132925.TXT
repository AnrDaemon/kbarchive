OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Adobe Type Manager (ATM) to the Windows\Fonts folder, you will
receive the following error message when you start the ATM Control Panel
(Atmcntrl.exe):

   Invalid Fonts Directory

No fonts are displayed and you must choose another folder.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows\Fonts folder is not a normal folder. This folder has a system
attribute that cannot be modified. The ATM installation program can set up ATM
in this folder, but ATM does not function correctly from this folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the ATM fonts from the Windows\Fonts folder,
remove the Atm.ini file from the Windows folder, and then install ATM again.
Choose a folder other than the Windows\Fonts folder for the installation.
