SYMPTOMS
========

If your PATH environment variable is longer than 128 characters, the Brief 3.0
text editor may behave erratically or stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 allows you to set a PATH variable that is longer than the Brief
editor can handle. Brief overwrites internal program variables when it
encounters a PATH variable that is longer than 128 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files to modify the PATH variable so that
it is no longer than 128 characters.
