TITLE   :Err Msg with IBM Optical Disk: Drive Cannot Find The Sector...
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you format an IBM 127 MB Optical Disk while running OS/2 or MS-DOS and
then boot Windows NT, the following error message appears when you in attempt to
view the drive from File Manager:

   Drive cannot find the sector requested.

If you format the optical disk using the Windows NT Disk Administrator, the disk
is formatted to 121 megabytes and the error message does not appear. However,
when you run CHKDSK on the disk from MS-DOS or OS/2, disk error messages appear.

CAUSE
=====

The disks are formatted under Windows NT as 121 megabyte disks. Under MS-DOS and
OS/2 they are formatted as 127 megabyte disks. This difference results in file
corruption errors when you try to use these optical disks under different
operating systems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
