TITLE   :S3 Adapter Using High Color Resolution May Have Blue Tint
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a High Color resolution (with more than 256 colors) with an
S3 video adapter, the colors on the screen may have a blue tint.

CAUSE
=====

The S3 display driver is using a different High Color mode from the mode set in
the video BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, add the following line to the [display] section of the
System.ini file and then restart your computer:

   HighColor=15

This setting forces the S3 driver to use the 555 mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A High Color mode can have one of two variations: a 555 mode or a 565 mode. In
the 555 mode, the blue component of the color is in the low five bits, the green
component is in the next five bits, and the red component is in the following
five bits. The high bit is not used. In the 565 mode, the low five bits are for
blue, the next six are for green, and the last five are for red.
