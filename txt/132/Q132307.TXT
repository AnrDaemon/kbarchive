OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log onto a computer running Windows NT, either locally or from another
Windows NT Server or Workstation, your logon script does not run. It runs
normally when you log on from a computer running Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Windows NT 3.5 Server primary domain controller
(PDC) that finds the script fails to parse the computer name correctly because
of a space in the computer name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use an underscore, dash, or another character in
place of the space in the computer name, or upgrade to Windows NT Server 3.51.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT version 3.51.
