OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience poor performance using the real-mode basic redirector to
access files on a Windows 95-based server running the Microsoft Client for
Microsoft Networks.

CAUSE
=====

The basic redirector incorrectly determines the maximum packet size when it
communicates with a Windows 95-based server that is using share-level security.
The maximum packet size the redirector uses is 207 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the Windows 95-based server to use user-level security. To make this
change, follow these steps on the server:

1. Use the right mouse button to click Network Neighborhood, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

2. On the Access Control tab, click User-Level Access Control.

3. Click OK.
