SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0 and above, allow users to
integrate customized DDX and DDV routines into the ClassWizard interface. The
Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) Technical Note 26 (TN026) describes
this feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TN026 describes how users can integrate their own DDX and DDV routines into the
Class Wizard interface. For Visual C++ version 2.x, this is accomplished by
adding an [ExtraDDX] section and its appropriate entries to the APSTUDIO.INI
file in the Windows NT root directory. For Visual C++ version 4.0, this is
accomplished by adding the necessary entries to either the [General Info]
section of a particular project's .CLW file or in the [ExtraDDX] section of the
DDX.CLW file in the \MSDEV\BIN directory. The required format for entries of
both sections, [ExtraDDX] and [General Info] is clearly specified.

TN026 recommends that if a user plans to use the customized DDX and DDV routines
in many projects, they should add the appropriate entries to the [ExtraDDX]
section of the Visual C++ version 2.x APSTUDIO.INI file or the the Visual C++
version 4.0 DDX.CLW file. TN026 further recommends that if a user of Visual C++
version 4.0 plans to create these custom routines for just a few projects, then
it is better to just modify the [GeneralInfo] section of the .CLW files for the
particular projects.

By default, APSTUDIO.INI and DDX.CLW are not created. To do so, simply use a text
editor and add the [ExtraDDX] section or the [GeneralInfo] section,
respectively, as discussed above. APSTUDIO.INI must be placed into the Windows
NT root directory; DDX.CLW must be placed in the %MsDevDir%\BIN directory, where
%MsDevDir% is the full path to the installation directory of Visual C++ version
4.0.
