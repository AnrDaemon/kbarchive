SUMMARY
=======

To calculate percentages of a group total in report using the Report Writer, you
must create a UDF (user defined function).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FoxPro Report Writer calculates totals in a top down manner. To get a detail
item's percentage of a total that resides in the group footer band, the total
must first be calculated in the group header. This can be accomplished by using
the following code in a UDF:

         SET TALK OFF
      PUBLIC msum     && initialize variable for sum total
      msum=0
      y=RECNO()       && store record number to variable so total from
      * previous group is not added on
      x=<field name>  && store field which is grouped to variable
      SUM <numeric field name> FOR  x=<field name> TO msum
      GO y
      RETURN msum     && this will simply display the total in the group
      * header that appears in the group footer
