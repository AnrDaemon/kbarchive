SUMMARY
=======

Occasionally, you may get the error message "DDE Connection Failed" when you
view a file within SourceSafe. Other errors may be returned, such as "Unable to
Execute..." or "Error Opening...".

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when SourceSafe cannot open a file with its default editor.
This may be due to the editor file being moved, deleted, or mapped to a
different network drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, you must tell SourceSafe what editor to use for a
specified file:

1. Open the SS.INI file for that user (NOTE: The SRCSAFE.INI file may be used,
   but it is not suggested since each machine may be configured differently).

2. Add the line to tell SourceSafe the correct associations and file locations.
   Example:

   .DOC = C:\MSOFFICE\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXE %1

   NOTE: The %1 is needed to tell the DDE connection that this is the file that
   should be opened.

   IMPORTANT: If the applications path contains spaces, you must enclose the
   entire path in quotes (""), such as:

   .DOC = "C:\MS OFFICE\WINWORD\WINWORD.EXE" %1

3. Close and restart SourceSafe for the changes to take effect.

If you still have problems opening a file for viewing, then make sure that the
following have been checked:

1. The path to the .EXE is correct.

2. The .EXE file exists.

3. The extension is correct.

4. The extension line was put above any section headers in the INI file.

This technique can also be used to override any associations that may be made
with files. For instance, a user may want to view a .C file in Notepad, rather
than starting Visual C++ every time.
