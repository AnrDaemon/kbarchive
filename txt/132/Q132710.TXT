TITLE   :Err Msg Installing SQL 6.0: Setup Has Detected SMS Version 1.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbConfig smsgeneral smsconfig kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install SQL Server 6.0, the following error message appears:

   SMS - SQL Server Conflict

   Setup has detected SMS Version 1.0 is installed on this system.
   SMS 1.0 will not run correctly with this version of SQL Server.
   If you wish to proceed with the installation, choose Resume.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when:

 - You are installing or upgrading to SQL Server 6.0 and System Management
   Server 1.0 is installed.

 - The Systems Management Server 1.0 Administration Tools are currently
   installed, or were previously installed and then removed.

SQL Server 6.0 setup checks the following Window NT registry key to determine if
Systems Management Server 1.0 is installed:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\SMS\Setup\Version

If you are using build number 631 or below, this problem occurs. If the Systems
Management Administration Tools are removed from the system, the Version key
remains in the registry without any values, and SQL Server 6.0 installation
assumes that Systems Management Server 1.0 exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

 - Upgrade to Systems Management Server 1.1 before you upgrade from SQL Server
   4.21 to SQL Server 6.0,

-or-

 - If no previous SQL installation exists or the Systems Management Server 1.0
   Administration Tools were previously installed and removed, choose resume
   from the SQL conflict dialogue box.
