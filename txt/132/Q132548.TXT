This article shows by example how to use fields from multiple tables in a combo
or list box by placing a SQL SELECT command in the RowSource property.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form.

2. Open up the Data Environment and place the Products and Orditems tables in
   it.

3. Select the Combo box or List box tool from the form[ASCII 146]s Control
   toolbar, and place a combo or list box on the form.

4. Set the FirstElement property to 1, the NumberOfElements property to 1, and
   the RowSourceType property to 3-SQL Statement.

5. Add a SQL statement such as the following in the RowSource property:

         SELECT DISTINCT(padl(alltrim(orditems.product_id),2," ")) + ;
            "....." + products.prod_name AS prod FROM orditems, products ;
            INTO CURSOR items ;
            WHERE products.product_id = orditems.product_id ;
            ORDER BY prod

6. Run the form, and click the combo box down arrow to open up the list. The
   Product_id from the Orditems table will be the first thing in each line item
   with periods leading over to the product name (Prod_name) derived from the
   Products table.
