KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The RebootOnCE EXTERNAL.INI entry can not be used with the Microsoft Mail
Multitasking MTA for Windows NT (NT MMTA) or the OS/2 MMTA running under
Microsoft Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This switch is not valid under Windows NT because the redirector will never get
into a critical error state. If a server is not available, External will get
into a state where it marks that connection as disconnected and will retry each
interval regular.


Additional query words: 3.50
