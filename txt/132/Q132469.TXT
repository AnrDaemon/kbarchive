TITLE   :Windows NT 3.51 Setup Hangs on a Computer With Three IDE Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on a computer with a dual channel IDE controller and
three IDE hard disk drives, SETUP stop responding (hangs) after the mass storage
detection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs on systems with one hard drive on the primary channel and
two hard drives on the secondary channel. The IDE driver is expecting the first
channel to be fully populated before finding hard drives on the second channel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, move two of the drives to the primary channel and leave
the third drive on the secondary channel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
