======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) printer (or a printer that emulates an
HP printer) that is connected to a computer using a PS/2-style parallel port,
you may receive an extra page before each print job. The extra page contains PJL
codes or a single character in the upper left corner of the page. The output on
this page depends on whether you have enabled bi-directional communications.

NOTE: This problem does not occur with the Generic/Text Only printer driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Configure the port in your computer's CMOS settings to a non-PS/2 mode (for
   example, use standard LPT mode, or ECP or EPP mode).

   NOTE: This option is not supported on all computers.

 - There is an updated Lpt.vxd file on the Windows 95 CD-ROM that corrects this
   problem. To install the updated file, follow these steps:

   1. Use Windows Explorer to rename the Lpt.vxd file in the Windows\System
      folder to Lpt.old.

   2. Copy the Lpt.vxd file from the Drivers\Printer\LPT folder on the Windows
      95 CD-ROM to the Windows\System folder on the hard disk.

   3. Restart Windows 95.

   NOTE: If you do not have the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, you can obtain the
   alternate Lpt.vxd file from Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1. For
   information about obtaining Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see
   the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q142794 Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about the Lpt.vxd file, please see the Readme.txt
file in the Drivers\Printer\LPT folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

The Lpt.vxd file from the Windows 95 CD-ROM is version 4.00.503. To check the
version number of your Lpt.vxd file in Windows Explorer, click the file, click
Properties on the File menu, and in the File Properties dialog box click the
Version tab.

Note that the symptoms described in this article can also be caused by a printer
switchbox. If you are using a printer switchbox, you may want to disconnect the
switchbox to see if the problem persists.
