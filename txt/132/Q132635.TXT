TITLE   :Cannot Open Documents with Spaces in Name by Double-Clicking
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a file with a long filename that contains a space by
double-clicking the file in My Computer or Windows Explorer, you may receive the
following error message

   Cannot open "<name>" please verify the correct path and filename are
   given

where <name> is only part of the full filename.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the command line that is run when you double-click a file is exactly
what the associated program registered, except that the full path name is
substituted for %1 in the command line. If the registered command line does not
contain %1, the filename is appended to the end of the line. Some programs parse
the command line looking for arguments, and see the space in the appended
filename as a separator for an argument. Such programs try to open the file
using the portion of the filename before the space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Place ""%1"" (without the quotation marks) on the end of the command line for
the association with the specific document type. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. On the View menu of the window that opens, click Options.

3. Click the File Types tab.

4. In the Registered File Types box, click the appropriate file type, then click
   the Edit button.

5. In the Actions box, click Open, then click Edit.

6. In the Application Used To Perform Action box, add a space, and then type
   ""%1"" (without the quotation marks) to the end of the line.

7. Click OK.

8. Click Close twice.

NOTE: Editing other commands in the Actions box will ensure that they function
correctly also.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem applies only to 32-bit programs. 16-bit programs use the file's
short MS-DOS name, which does not contain spaces.
