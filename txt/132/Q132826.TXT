TITLE   :CSNAV List Box Does Not Scroll Properly When Updated
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95 appscomp kbAppCompatibility

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The session window of CSNAV (a program used to connect to CompuServe) has a list
box that is updated as your session runs, letting you see the outcome of your
logon session. In Windows 95, as new items are added to the list box, the list
is not updated to show you the last item added.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because of the new proportional scroll bars used by list
boxes in Windows 95. The new scroll bar ranges and positions confuse CSNAV's
scrolling code, and as a result, the list box does not scroll as items are
added.

RESOLUTION
==========

To follow the outcome of your session, manually scroll the new items into view.

STATUS
======

This situation is most likely caused by design changes in Windows 95. Microsoft
has confirmed that it is not caused by a problem in Windows 95. For more
information about resolving this issue, contact the manufacturer.
