======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the game "Dracula Unleashed" (distributed by Viacom) in a Windows
95 MS-DOS session, the computer stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

"Dracula Unleashed" uses programming techniques incompatible with Windows 95;
therefore, you must run the game in MS-DOS mode.


RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 95 should automatically run "Dracula Unleashed" in MS-DOS mode. However,
you may have to delete any Dracula.pif files first. If "Dracula Unleashed" still
does not run properly, set the game's properties manually. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. In My Computer, using the right mouse button, click the Dracula Unleashed
   icon, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. In the Dracula Unleashed Properties dialog box, click the Program tab, and
   then click the Advanced button.

3. Make sure the MS-DOS mode box is checked.

4. Select the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration button.

5. Click the OK button on all the dialog boxes that appear.

For the game to run properly, you may have to add a sound card, a mouse, or
CD-ROM support.

To run the game, double-click the Dracula Unleashed icon or type the program name
in the Run dialog box on the Start menu. If you type the program name at the
MS-DOS prompt, the program's settings are bypassed.
