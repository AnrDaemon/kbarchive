TITLE   :Compaq Screen Does Not Wake Up After EnergyStar Shutdown
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to "wake up" your computer after Advanced Power Management (APM)
has shut down the screen, the screen may remain in sleep mode. To re-activate
the screen you must turn the computer off and back on.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur with Compaq computers using the Cirrus Logic 54xxx video
chip set because of a conflict between APM and the computer's BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

 - Do not enable APM in the computer's CMOS settings.

 - Do not inform Windows 95 that the monitor is EnergyStar compliant.

 - Disable APM in Device Manager in Windows 95.

 - Contact Compaq about obtaining a BIOS upgrade.
