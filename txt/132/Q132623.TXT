TITLE   :Mixer Does Not Work After Upgrading to Windows 95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The mixer program included with your Paradise sound card may not work after you
upgrade to Windows 95. Additionally, the mixer control included with Windows 95
does not affect the volume of sounds being played.

CAUSE
=====

The Paradise card is really both a SoundBlaster 8-bit sound card and a Microsoft
Windows Sound System-compatible sound card. Windows 95 installs drivers for both
of these cards, causing previous proprietary volume- control methods to not
work. The Windows 95 mixer control does work, but it is operating on the default
audio device. If the default device is not the device being used (such as when
the default device is the SoundBlaster device and you are playing a 16-bit file,
so the Windows Sound System- compatible device is being used), adjusting the
controls has no effect.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Windows Sound System-compatible device as the preferred device using the
Multimedia tool in Control Panel.
