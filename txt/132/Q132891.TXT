The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, versions 3.04, 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

You may see the characters v.# (where # is an integer) appear to the right of a
filename in the SourceSafe interface (the 'v.#' is visible in the column where
the user name of the person who has the file checked out normally appears). The
presence of these characters indicates the file has been shared at the specific
version indicated by the number.

Sharing at an explicit version makes the indicated version the current version in
the file. When a file is shared at an explicit version you cannot checkout the
file. If you wish to make modifications to the older version of the file you
could either:

 - Separate the file(s) to a new project at an older version and make the
   modifications in the new project.

-or-

 - Roll back the file to the older version. This is permanently destroys any
   changes you have made to the file since this version and is therefore not
   recommended.

To get back to the latest version of the file:

1. Select the file.

2. Do a history of the file.

3. Select the latest version of the file.

4. Select the 'Share' button.

You will get the prompt "Always use the latest version <filename>?". Select
Yes. At this point, you can check out the file from the project again.
