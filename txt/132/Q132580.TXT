======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Close-Up, you receive the following error message when you
start Windows 95:

   Cannot find a device file that may be needed to run Windows. Make sure that
   the path...

The file that cannot be found is Vddvga.vxd.

CAUSE
=====

Close-Up must change the video driver in order to support desktop display on a
remote computer. However, Close-Up does not modify the Windows system files
directly. Instead, it installs a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that
watches for an application trying to read the System.ini file (as Windows 95
does at startup). When Windows 95 reaches the display driver line in the
System.ini file, the TSR steps in and patches the read operation on the fly.
However, the file that the patch references (Vddvga.vxd) is not part of Windows
95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Since no changes were made to the system files there is no workaround. Windows
95 is not a supported platform for the Host side of Close-Up, but does work as a
Guest workstation. Norton-Lambert plans to release a version of Close-Up that is
compatible with Windows 95.
