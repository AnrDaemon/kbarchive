TITLE   :Updated Proteon 139X NDIS Driver Needed for Network Client 3.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.0,3.5,3.5,3.51,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5,3.51, 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5,3.51 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Network Client Administrator utility provided with the Windows NT Server
CD-ROM, is used to create a network installation startup disk for Microsoft
Network Client version 3.0. If the Proteon Token Ring P1390 or P1392 network
interface cards (NICs) are used, the startup disk may fail to initialize
properly. Both of these NICs use the Proteon 139x NDIS driver, (NDIS39XR.DOS).

Your computer stops responding (hangs) with the following error:

   EMM386: DMA Mode Not Supported.
   Press ENTER to Reboot.

If you remark out the EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS file, the network fails
to initialize and the system hangs with the following error:

   M0010: Driver configuration error


CAUSE
=====

The EMM386 error is caused by the driver attempting to perform direct memory
access (DMA) using a mode not supported by the EMM386 expanded- memory manager.
The system has become unstable and must be restarted.

The M0010 error is a generic message, generated as a result of NIC/driver
configuration issues.

RESOLUTION
==========

Proteon has updated the NDIS driver for 139x adapters. A newer version dated
6/6/95 corrects the EMM386 problem. The drivers can be downloaded from Proteon's
BBS @ 508-366-7827. The file to download is 39WFW311.EXE.


Replace NDIS39XR.DOS in the NET directory on the startup disk with the new
driver.
