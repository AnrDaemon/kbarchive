TITLE   :HP Ethertwist PC Lan Adapter/16 Plus Error Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HP Ethertwist PC Lan Adapter/16 Plus, you may receive an error
message (one of various error messages), but the adapter card functions
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The HP Ethertwist PC Lan Adapter/16 Plus can operate in an I/O mapped mode with
no upper memory use (default), or in memory mapped mode with a 2 kilobyte upper
memory buffer.

The Windows 95 driver provided to Microsoft by Hewlett-Packard does not have an
option for I/O mapped mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To stop the error messages from appearing, reset the adapter card to memory
mapped mode using the manufacturer-supplied Setup program (HPlanset.exe).

For instructions about how to use the adapter card Setup program, refer to the
documentation that came with the card, or contact the manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use HPlanset.exe to configure the adapter card for I/O mode, Windows 95
notifies you that the card is not responding correctly, but the card functions
correctly anyway. As long as the card is in I/O mode, when you start the
computer, the warning message appears.

After the warning messages are generated, the driver then automatically sets the
adapter card to memory mapped mode for operation.
