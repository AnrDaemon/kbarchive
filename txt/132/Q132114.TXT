-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

If you remove the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 sound card in Device Manager,
and then use the Add New Hardware Wizard to detect and re-install it, the sound
card may be incorrectly detected as an Ad Lib Gold Compatible (OPL3) sound card.

CAUSE
=====

Removing the Sound Blaster 16 sound card in Device Manager leaves the device in
an unrecoverable state. As a result, the Add New Hardware Wizard cannot reliably
detect the card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, turn your computer off and then back on before you
run the Add New Hardware Wizard. If you have already run the Add New Hardware
Wizard, use the following steps to remove the incorrectly detected sound card:

1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties on the
   menu that appears.

2. Click the Device Manager tab.

3. Double-click the Sound, Video, And Game Controllers branch to expand it.

4. Click the Ad Lib Gold Compatible (OPL3) sound card.

5. Click Remove.

6. Click OK.
