SUMMARY
=======

This article provides an example to illustrate the use of the ShowMenu and Addin
methods of the Class Browser.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Class Browser allows you to browse and perform diverse tasks on classes
stored in visual class libraries (.VCX files). You can customize the Class
Browser by modifying the properties and methods it exposes. The example provided
in this article uses the ShowMenu and the Addin methods of the Class Browser.

The ShowMenu method displays a menu built from an array. The source array can
have two dimensions defining a menu item and a corresponding action. When a menu
option is selected, the action is executed. The example in this article creates
a two-dimensional array.

The Addin method provides a way to add user-defined code to the methods exposed
by the Class Browser. The code can be linked to a method exposed by the Class
Browser or invoked from the Add_In menu. The example in this article calls the
add-in program from the Add_In menu. For an example on how to tie a program to a
method of the Class Browser, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Copy and paste the following code into a program (.PRG) file. Save the file
   as CBMENU.PRG. This code defines a two-dimensional array and calls the
   ShowMenu method.

      * Class Browser add-in example:
      * Add-in install:  _oBrowser.AddIn('Menu Example,'CBMENU')
      * Add-in uninstall:  _oBrowser.AddIn('Menu Example',.NULL.)

      LPARAMETERS oSource
      LOCAL laMenu

      DIMENSION laMenu[3,2]
      laMenu=''
      laMenu[1,1]='Apples'
      laMenu[1,2]="DO food with 'Apples'"
      laMenu[2,1]='Oranges'
      laMenu[2,2]="DO food with 'Oranges'"
      laMenu[3,1]='Plums'
      laMenu[3,2]="DO food with 'Plums'"

      oSource.ShowMenu(@laMenu)
      RETURN

      FUNCTION food
      PARAMETER cstring
      WAIT WINDOW cstring NOWAIT
      RETURN

2. Start the Class Browser by using one of the following two methods.

    - Select the Class Browser option from the Tools menu, and open BUTTONS.VCX
      located in the SAMPLES\CONTROLS directory.

   -or-

    - Type "DO (_BROWSER) WITH "C:\VFP\SAMPLES\CONTROLS\BUTTONS.VCX"" (without
      the quotation marks)

3. When the Class Browser starts, the _oBrowser variable is created. It refers
   to an instance of the Class Browser. To register the add-in program, type:

      _oBrowser.AddIn('Menu Example','CBMENU')

   This adds a record to the BROWSER.DBF table and registers the CBMENU program
   as a menu item. Once CBMENU is registered, the string "Menu Example" will be
   displayed from the Add-in menu.

4. Click the AddIn button in the Class Browser window. A menu is displayed.

5. Select Menu Example. The CBMENU program is run, and it executes the ShowMenu
   method. The user defined menu is displayed.
