SYMPTOMS
========

Duplicate SCSI device entries appear in Device Manager, and many unexplained
drive letters appear in Windows Explorer or My Computer.

CAUSE
=====

A SCSI device is installed that has the same device ID of 2, 7, or 15 as another
SCSI device detected on the computer.

Duplicate SCSI device entries appear in Device Manager when a SCSI device with an
ID of 7 or 15 is put on the same SCSI ID as the SCSI controller. SCSI
controllers are typically on SCSI ID 7 or ID 15 (on a wide SCSI interface).

If a SCSI device detects another device on ID 2, it usually means that two SCSI
controllers are using the same chain on ID 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

If a SCSI device conflicts with another SCSI device on ID 7 or ID 15 (on a wide
SCSI interface), change the SCSI ID of the duplicated SCSI device to an unused
ID, such as 3, 4, 5, or 6.

If two SCSI controllers conflict with each other on ID 2, break the chain. For
example, make sure the internal cable goes only to the internal device (or
devices), not to a PCI card.
