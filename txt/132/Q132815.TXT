TITLE   :Server-Based Setup Crashes After Setting Up Hardware
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows 95 may stop responding (hang) during a server-based installation on an
EISA computer using a NetBEUI connection. You may receive an error message on a
blue screen after the first reboot at the Setting Up Hardware screen.

CAUSE
=====

The configuration manager is turning NetBEUI off dynamically during the
installation process, and causing the network connection to be lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart the computer and allow Setup to continue. Setup should continue and
finish correctly. The computer is set up correctly and will run correctly. This
problem has no effect on the setup process.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
