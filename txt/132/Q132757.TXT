-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print a document in CorelDRAW version 4.0, you may receive a
general protection (GP) fault in Cdrgrfx40. In CorelDRAW version 5.0, you may
receive a GP fault in Cdrgfx50.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the path to the printer contains more than 19
characters. CorelDRAW cannot handle a path of more than 19 characters to the
printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

 - Use a printer path with 19 or less characters. For example, the path

   \\server123\printer (19 characters)

   works, but the path

   \\server123\printer1 (20 characters)

   does not.

 - Redirect an LPT port to the network printer share. To do so, follow these
   steps:

    - Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Printers.

    - Use the right mouse button to click the printer icon, then click
      Properties on the menu that appears.

    - On the Details tab, click Capture Printer Port.

    - In the Device box, click the printer port you want to redirect.

    - In the Path box, type the path for the network printer.

    - If you want to use this printer each time you start Windows 95, click the
      Reconnect At Logon check box to select it.

    - Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem usually occurs when you are printing to a network printer, but can
also occur when you print to a file with a path of more than 19 characters.
