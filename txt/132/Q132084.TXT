TITLE   :NMAKE 1.4 on Windows 95 Won't Stop on Errors
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.5,1.51,1.52
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfile

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On Windows 95, NMAKE version 1.4 will not stop building if a command in the
makefile returns an error. For example, if the command invokes the Visual C++
compiler (CL.EXE) and the file being compiled causes a compiler error, NMAKE
ignores it and continues the build. This is not the expected behavior. By
default, NMAKE should stop on error returns from commands in a makefile.

NOTE: The problem occurs only when running NMAKE 1.4 on Windows 95. On Windows
95, use version 1.5 or later of NMAKE.EXE or use NMAKER.EXE.

NOTE: NMAKE version 1.5 is a 32-bit executable that requires a 32-bit operating
system. It will not work on Windows version 3.x. You need to continue using
NMAKE version 1.4 under Windows version 3.x.

NMAKER.EXE ships with 16-bit Visual C++, versions 1.x, and is in the \MSVC\BIN
directory. If you are building external makefiles from within the development
environment, you must rename NMAKE.EXE to another filename, and then rename
NMAKER.EXE to NMAKE.EXE.

If you own Visual C++, 32-bit edition, version 2.x, NMAKE version 1.5 is
available in the \msvc20\bin subdirectory. If you copy NMAKE.EXE to another
directory, copy NMAKE.ERR (an error text file for this version of NMAKE) to the
same directory.
