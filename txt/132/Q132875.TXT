TITLE   :MS Exchange Setup Wizard Loses Information When Backing Up
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard, information that you
entered in a previous page is discarded if you back up to that page.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The Wizard retains all the information entered in
the provider pages as long as you remain in the provider pages section or move
forward. If you back out of the provider pages section, the Wizard discards all
data and resources entered up to that point and reverts to the default entries.

RESOLUTION
==========

You must enter the information again when you return to the section.

Additional query words: XCLNWin95 XProSFS
