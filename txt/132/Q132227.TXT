TITLE   :PRB: Can't Activate or Access an Object

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you define a class in a program (.PRG file) and run it, nothing happens.
For example, the following code, when run in a .PRG file, executes and return to
the Command window:

      DEFINE CLASS myform AS form
            ADD OBJECT cmd1 as commandbutton WITH ;
                    top = 10, ;
                    left = 10
      ENDDEFINE

CAUSE
=====

A class is simply a template or definition from which an object will be created.
Defining a class does not create an instance of the class.

RESOLUTION
==========

Building on the example above, the code example creates a template from which a
new object can be created. To instantiate the defined class, you must add this
additional code:

         PUBLIC MyForm
      MyForm = CREATEOBJECT("MyForm")  && Create a new object
      MyForm.Show                      && Show the form
      Read Events                      && Keep the event loop alive

      DEFINE CLASS myform AS form
         ADD OBJECT cmd1 as commandbutton WITH ;
            top  = 60, ;
            left = 60
      ENDDEFINE

To cancel this code, click the Command box for this form, and click Close. Then
on the Visual FoxPro menu, on the Program menu, click Cancel.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
