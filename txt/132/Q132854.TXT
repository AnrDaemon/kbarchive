PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.1d
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a group within a group on Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks,
the nested group may not be properly deleted from a downstream server, when the
original group is deleted and a new group is created on the originating server.

CAUSE
=====

When the nested group is deleted from the originating server (the one that first
created both groups) and a new group is immediately added, the information
propagated to the downstream servers does not contain the updated group
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To refresh the group information on the downstream servers, go to the
originating server, sign in as Network Administrator and follow these steps:

1. From the Mail menu, choose Server Users/Groups.

2. Select the group button.

3. Select Modify Group, then select the group name.

4. Click the Address button, and add a user to the group. Click the Close
   button.

5. Click Modify, and wait for the change to appear on the downstream server.

6. Redo steps 4 and 5, only remove the user you just added.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.1d of Microsoft Mail
for AppleTalk Networks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
