SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Mail
Transfer Agent (MTA) with Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows (or MS-DOS) using a
U.S. Robotics Sportster 28.8 V.34 modem, the MTA may never answer. Therefore, it
causes the Remote user to time out.

CAUSE

04/18/95 have a ROM BIOS chip defect.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is a known issue with U.S. Robotics. Please contact U.S. Robotics Technical
Support at (708) 982-5151 for information on upgrading the modem.
