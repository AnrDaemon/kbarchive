TITLE   :Cannot Print with Avery LabelPro
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you rename or remove the default printer in Windows 95, you may receive one
of the following error messages when you try to print from Avery LabelPro:

 - No printer driver files found

 - No installed printer drivers

CAUSE
=====

Avery LabelPro stores the name of the default printer in a file called
Lpwin.ini. When the name of the default printer is changed, Avery LabelPro does
not respond to the global Win.ini file change notification message, and does not
update the Lpwin.ini file to reflect the new default printer name. Therefore,
when you attempt to print from Avery LabelPro, the default printer cannot be
located.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the Lpwin.ini file and modify the "Printer=" entry so that its value equals
the new default printer name. You can find the name of the default printer in
the "Device=" entry in the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file. For example,
you might find the following line in the [Windows] section of the Win.ini file:

   device=HP LaserJet 4/4M,HPPCL5MS,LPT1

To resolve this problem, modify the "Printer=" entry in the Lpwin.ini file so
that it reads:

   Printer=HP LaserJet 4/4M
