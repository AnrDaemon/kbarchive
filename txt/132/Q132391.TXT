The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Art Gallery for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play an animation in Art Gallery, you may receive the following
error message:

   Sorry, there was a problem playing the animation.

This occurs if your monitor is set to display more than 256 colors.

RESOLUTION
==========

The monitor must be set to 256 colors to successfully run animations.

To set the display to 256 colors do the following:

1. Open the Monitors Control Panel.

2. Select 256 colors. Close the Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Art Gallery is started, the following warning appears if the monitor is set
for more than 256 colors:

   Microsoft Art Gallery runs best when the monitor is set to 256 colors. Your
   monitor is currently set to run in thousands (or millions) of colors.
   Continuing to run in thousands of colors may affect speed and will disable
   animations. If you want Microsoft Art Gallery to switch your monitor's color
   setting for you, click 'Switch Now'.

Clicking Switch Now resets the monitor to 256 colors. Clicking Continue starts
Art Gallery, but as the warning states, animation errors will continue. Clicking
Quit closes Art Gallery.
