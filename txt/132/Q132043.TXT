======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run User Manager and enter a home directory path that uses one or more
characters after the %<variable>% string, the following error message
appears:

   The home directory <Directory Path> for <User Name> could not be
   created. The user account has been updated. You must create the Home
   Directory manually.

For example, this problem occurs when you attempt to put your home directory on a
hidden share (\\SERVER\%USERNAME%$), or you attempt to put your home directory
on a share with an extension (\\SERVER\%USERNAME%.XXX).

WORKAROUND
==========

Currently, you can work around this problem only by not using the %USERNAME%
variable if additional characters need to follow it to complete the share name.
