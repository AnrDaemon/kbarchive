TITLE   :Customized Setting For Access Reverts Back to Original
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you distribute a package with Systems Management Server containing
Microsoft Access 2.0, customize the toolbar settings, and exit and restart
Access, the customized toolbar settings are not available. PGC resets the Access
toolbar settings every time Access runs.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the SystemDB entry in MSACC20.INI points to the
SYSTEM.MDA file on the distribution server. Even after you manually change the
entry to point to the local SYSTEM.MDA file (which contains the customized
toolbar settings), the entry is changed automatically to point to the SYSTEM.MDA
file on the distribution server when you run Access.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Modify the SMSSHARE.STF file in the SMSPROXY subdirectory of the Microsoft
   Access package directory on the Systems Management Server (distribution
   server). Change:

      %s\system.mda                  (line 88)
      %s\workdir\system.mda          (line 89)
      %s\system.mda                  (line 761)

   to:

      %1\system.mda                  (for all three lines)

2. In the MSACC20.INI file, change the SystemDB entry to:

      [Options]
      SystemDB=<local drive>:\ACCESS\SYSTEM.MDA

3. Do one of the following, depending on the network operating system your
   client computer is using:

   Windows NT Client
   -----------------

   WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
   problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
   Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
   Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

   a. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

   b. From the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT subtree, go to the following subkey:

         \SMS\Applications\msaccess\DAEE\Profile0

   c. Remove the [Options][SystemDB] entry.

      NOTE: A Microsoft Test script, distributed as a PCM job, can remove the
      Registry entry each time Microsoft Access runs.

   d. Quit Registry Editor.

   Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Client
   ----------------------------------

   a. Run the Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) with the following
      command:

         REGEDIT /V

   b. Go to the following subkey:

         \SMS\Applications\msaccess\DAEE\Profile0

   c. Remove the [Options][SystemDB] entry.

   d. Quit REGEDIT.EXE.
