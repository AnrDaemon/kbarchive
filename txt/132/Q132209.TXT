The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Schedule+, you can View Free/Busy times on a remote postoffice via modem or
an asynchronous connection if the Schedule Distribution program (SCHDIST.EXE) is
used on both sides of the asynchronous connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SCHDIST.EXE processes the Free/Busy information into .POF files. SCHDIST.EXE
then prepares the .POF files for distribution as it converts them into
attachments within Mail messages. The External Mail program (EXTERNAL.EXE) is
then responsible for delivering the messages to the other postoffices.

If users on a postoffice are defined via the External-Admin option of the Mail
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) as direct (or indirect) via modem, the
following access privileges do not work:

 - View Free/Busy times with dynamic connections.

 - Access privileges of Read Appointments and Tasks or higher.

These access privileges require a persistent network connection.
