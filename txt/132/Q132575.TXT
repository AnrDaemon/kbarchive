======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows Explorer (Explorer.exe) to examine the contents of a disk
drive, you see any of the following symptoms after you remove a disk from the
disk drive and insert a new disk:

 - The right side of the Explorer window continues to display the contents of
   the original disk.

 - The right side of the Explorer window displays the contents of the new disk,
   but the left side continues to display folders from the original disk.

 - After expanding the disk drive branch by double-clicking the branch or by
   clicking the plus sign (+) to the left of the branch, the left side of the
   Explorer window displays folders from both the original disk and the new
   disk, and the right side continues to display the contents of the original
   disk.

This problem may also occur with other types of removable media, such as CD-ROM
or Syquest drives.

CAUSE
=====

On most computers, Windows Explorer is not automatically notified when the disk
in a disk drive changes.

-or-

The Auto Insert Notification check box has been cleared in Device Manager,
causing media changes not to be reported by the 32-bit CD-ROM driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

After you remove a disk from a disk drive and insert a new disk, refresh the
Windows Explorer display by clicking Refresh on the View menu, or by pressing
F5.

-or-

To enable Windows 95 to update CD-ROM directory listings when you are using
32-bit drivers, follow these steps to enable the Auto Insert Notification
option:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click CD-ROM, and then double-click the
   installed CD-ROM device.

3. On the Settings tab, click the Auto Insert Notification check box to select
   it.

4. Click Close. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
