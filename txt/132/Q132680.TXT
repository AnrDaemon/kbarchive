TITLE   :PRB: Hiding a Modal Form Removes Its Modal Attribute
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a modal form is displayed and then hidden, it looses its modal attribute.
That is, when the form is shown, the user can access other windows if the form
was hidden by clicking Hide on the Window menu or by using the HIDE WINDOW
command.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can prevent users from hiding the form from the interface by removing the
Hide option from the Window menu with this command:

      RELEASE BAR _Mwi_Hide OF _Mwindow

If you are hiding the form under program control, use the Hide and Show methods
of the form instead of the HIDE WINDOW and SHOW WINDOW commands. Using these
methods maintains the modality of the form.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. It avoids the problem of not being able to access
anything when the modal form is hidden.
