The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The "Desk Accessories" are still available in Visual FoxPro but are now
undocumented. They are included for backward compatibility only and are not
documented in the books or Help files with the exception of the FILER Command.
New applications should not use them because they may not be supported in future
versions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can access the old "Desk Accessories" in Visual FoxPro by executing the
following Commands:

   *** To open the Calculator
   ACTIVATE WINDOW CALCULATOR

   *** To open the Calendar/Diary
   ACTIVATE WINDOW CALENDAR

   *** To open the Puzzle
   ACTIVATE WINDOW PUZZLE

   *** To open the Filer
   FILER

NOTE: The Calendar/Diary does display a Diary menu when it is activated, and it
appears there is no way to get to the "Calculator Preferences."
