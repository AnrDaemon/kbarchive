SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the computer name used to identify your computer on the
network, some 16-bit networking programs may continue to identify your computer
using the old computer name.

CAUSE
=====

When you change the computer name on the Network tool's Identification tab, the
registry is updated to reflect the new name but the System.ini file is not. Most
16-bit networking programs read the computer name from the System.ini file
instead of from the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually modify the computer name in the System.ini
file. To do so, modify the "ComputerName=" line in the [Network] section of the
file so that it contains the correct computer name.
