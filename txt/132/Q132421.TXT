SYMPTOMS
========

A "Timeout Locking File" error occurs if the SRCSAFE.INI file contains Lock_Mode
= lockfile.

CAUSE
=====

This error indicates a lock file (.LCK extension) exists in the DATA\LOCKS
directory. This situation occurs under either of the following circumstances:

 - A user has a file locked. For example, a file is locked while it is updated.

 - A SourceSafe lock file has not been deleted from the DATA\LOCKS directory.

NOTE: To ensure the lock file is not in use, verify all users are out of
SourceSafe before using the second workaround described below.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following workarounds to resolve this error:

 - Increase the Lock_Timeout setting. This method works best in situations where
   users are updating large files, or the network is slower than normal.
   Increasing this setting allows SourceSafe additional time before issuing the
   "Timeout Locking File" error.

 - Check the DATA\LOCKS directory for any undeleted files. If the error seems to
   persist, even when no one is running SourceSafe, a lock file may not have
   been successfully deleted from the DATA\LOCKS directory. You can check this
   directory for old undeleted lock files (.LCK extension).


NOTE: This error also occurs if the DATA\LOCKS directory has not been created
properly. For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
