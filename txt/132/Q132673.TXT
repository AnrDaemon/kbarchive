TITLE   :NET VIEW /DOMAIN: <domainname> Command Fails
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:msnets win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In real mode, the command "net view /domain: <domainname>" fails and you
receive the following error message:

   Error 6118: The computer(s) sharing resources in this workgroup cannot be
   located. The computer(s) might have been restarted. Wait a few minutes, and
   then try again. If the problem persists, make sure your network-adapter
   settings are correct.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Basic redirector included in Net.exe does not
support viewing LAN Manager and Windows NT domains.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the Basic redirector does support the viewing of workgroups, the command
"net view /domain" functions in an MS-DOS Command window.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that the /DOMAIN (or abbreviated /D) switch is not documented in online
Help for the NET VIEW command. If you type "net view /?" this switch is not
listed.
