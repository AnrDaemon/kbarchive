SYMPTOMS
========

If you have user-level access control enabled in Windows 95 and click OK in the
File And Print Sharing dialog box or Add on the Remote Administration tab in the
Passwords Properties dialog box, you may receive the following error message:

   You cannot view the list of users at this time. Please try again later.

CAUSE
=====

The list of users may not be available if the authenticating server is not
active on the network or cannot be found because of network configuration
problems.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that user-level access control is configured correctly. To do so, follow
these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Access Control tab.

3. In the "Obtain list of users and groups from" box, note the name that is
   specified. This should be the name of your network domain.
