MORE INFORMATION
================

In versions of Windows prior to Windows 95, after Windows Help starts, the Setup
program for Carbon Copy brings the Help window to the foreground. Because of the
ability of Windows 95 to run multiple programs at the same time, Windows Help
may not be fully started when the Setup program tries to bring it to the
foreground.
