OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Eagle NE200T PCMCIA card does not work with the provided NE200.com ODI
driver. This only affects users trying to run the NE200.com ODI driver with a
real mode card and socket services and any of the Microsoft protected mode
32-bit network clients.

CAUSE
=====

The driver from Eagle conflicts with the Msodisup.Vxd file because it randomly
writes to memory space required by Microsoft network support.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the ODI driver with the real mode Novell Netware Client. This requires the
removal of any of Microsoft's network clients.

-or-

Use the Microsoft 32-bit network driver for this card. Use of this driver
requires the installation of the Microsoft Client for Netware that provides the
user with full 32-bit network functionality on a Netware network.
