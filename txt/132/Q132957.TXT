TITLE   :Removable-Media Drives Not Automatically Mounted at Startup
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95, a compressed volume on a removable-media drive (such
as a Bernoulli or Syquest drive) may not be automatically mounted.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the computer has two floppy disk drives and the
following settings exist in the Drvspace.ini file:

 - MaxRemovableDrives=2

 - AutoMount=1

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, increase the value of the MaxRemovableDrives setting to
match the total number of removable-media drives in the computer. For example,
if your computer has two floppy disk drives and a double Bernoulli drive, use
the setting "MaxRemovableDrives=4" (two floppy disk drives plus two Bernoulli
drives).

To edit the Drvspace.ini file, follow these steps.

1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the Drvspace.ini file in the root directory of
   the boot drive.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the Drvspace.ini file, then click
   Properties on the menu that appears.

3. Click the Read-only check box to clear it, then click OK.

4. Double-click the Drvspace.ini file to open it.

5. Make either of the following changes to the file:

    - Change the value of the MaxRemovableDrives setting to match the total
      number of removable-media drives.

      -or-

    - Set the AutoMount entry to the drive letters assigned to the
      removable-media drives. For example, if you have a double Bernoulli drive
      with drive letters D and E assigned to the drive, use the setting
      "AutoMount=DE."

6. Save and then close the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that when you are using an Iomega RCD driver with a double Bernoulli drive,
you may receive a "General Failure" error message the first time you access the
second drive. This causes automatic activation and automatic mounting to fail.
Using an Iomega OAD or SCSI driver resolves the problem.
