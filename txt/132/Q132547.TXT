The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To create send-only postoffices with the Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for
Windows NT (NT MMTA) when you run the External Mail program as a service, use
the Use WAN Drives check box in the Edit Service dialog box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the External Mail program is run as a service, it dynamically allocates
three drive letters starting at the first available drive. Because these drives
are not known at the time the External Mail program is run, the DrivesWAN option
cannot be used.

To create send-only postoffices, check the Use WAN Drives check box. This option
causes all postoffices in that instance to be send-only. For example, if this
option is used with the below instance, the External Mail program will send mail
to PO1-PO4, and it will not distribute the mail to the users on the destination
postoffice, nor does it check the destination postoffice for outgoing mail.
Another External Mail program must be running at the destination postoffice to
assume these responsibilities.

   [External-DrivesWAN]
   DrivesUNC=\\server\po1
   DrivesUNC=\\server\po2
   DrivesUNC=\\server\po3
   DrivesUNC=\\server\po4

When this instance is started, External will map drives E, F, and G (if this is
the first instance, and E is the first available drive), where E is the home
postoffice; F is used for sending, and G is for receiving mail. The External
Service will apply DrivesWAN to the sending F drive.

Because all DrivesUNCs in a particular instance will have the DrivesWAN option
applied, it will be necessary to create another instance for postoffices that
are not send-only.
