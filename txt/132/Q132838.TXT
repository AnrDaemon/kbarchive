SYMPTOMS
========

When you build or compile a program in the IDE of Microsoft Visual C++, the
screen switches to text mode. After the program is built or compiled, the screen
switches back to graphics.

CAUSE
=====

An old _Default.pif file is located on the path that is marked as "full screen."
The reason this affects compiling is because Microsoft Visual C++ spawns hidden
console programs to compile. Because Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.x itself is
marked as a Windows version 3.x program, for compatibility, Windows 95 searches
for a Default.pif file when it runs console or MS-DOS programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

 - Remove the old _Default.pif file from the current path

 - Set the _Default.pif file as windowed using PIFEDIT

 - Delete the _Default.pif file.
