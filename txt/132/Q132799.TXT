TITLE   :General Protection Fault in Pscript.drv When Printing
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document on a PostScript printer, you may receive a general
protection (GP) fault in the Pscript.drv file.

CAUSE
=====

The current implementation of the Windows 95 PostScript driver can only support
a maximum of 590 Adobe Type Manager (ATM) fonts. If the total number of ATM
fonts installed is 590 or greater, you may receive a GP fault.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, reduce the number of ATM fonts to a number less
than 590.
