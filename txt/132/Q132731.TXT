-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the DISPATCH.LOG file, the following error may be displayed:

   NSDA -xx terminated with exit code 2

where xx could be RT, RR, or S.

CAUSE
=====

Dispatch is unable to locate the Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that all the following Dir-Sync files are available and in the same
directory location.

   DISPATCH.EXE
   NSDA.EXE
   REQMAIN.EXE
   SRVMAIN.EXE
   IMPORT.EXE
   REBUILD.EXE

NOTE: Do not rely on a search path to launch DISPATCH.EXE, as it will not be able
to find the rest of the Dir-Sync executables. Only run DISPATCH.EXE from its own
directory location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Dispatch finds a ready process to execute, it launches the appropriate NSDA
process.

   At T1, DISPATCH launches NSDA -RT
   At T2, DISPATCH launches NSDA -S
   At T3, DISPATCH launches NSDA -RR

NSDA in turn launches other programs.

   At T1, NSDA launches REQMAIN -t
   At T2, NSDA launches SRVMAIN -r and SRVMAIN -t
   At T3, NSDA launches REQMAIN -r, IMPORT... and REBUILD...
