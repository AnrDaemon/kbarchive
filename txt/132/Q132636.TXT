SYMPTOMS
========

When you select Eject PC or otherwise try to warm undock your computer, Windows
prompts you with following warning dialog box:

   Windows cannot determine if it can remove this device safely.

   To try removing this device, make sure you have closed all your documents and
   programs, and then click Test.

   If the test is successful, you can probably remove this device safely. If you
   encounter problems, you cannot remove this device safely while Windows is
   running. You must turn off your computer, and then remove this device.

   What do you want to do?

   Test Cancel

   [ ] Device can be removed safely. Do not display this message again.

CAUSE
=====

In order to prepare for undocking, Windows must remove the devices in the
docking station. Windows prompts programs and device drivers if it is safe to
remove a device before it removes it. However, sometimes Windows is unsure if it
is safe to remove a device. When this happens, Windows prompts you to test the
removal of the device.

RESOLUTION
==========

The first time you see this warning dialog box, click Test. If the warm
undocking proceeds without any errors, then it is probably safe to remove the
device, and you can select the "Device can be removed safely. Do not display
this message again" check box.

If the computer locks up or otherwise malfunctions, click Cancel, and do not try
warm undocking with this computer in the future.
