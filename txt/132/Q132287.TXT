TITLE   :3Com 3C509B ODI Driver Fails to Load in Windows 95
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to load the ODI driver for the 3Com Etherlink III 3C509B Plug
and Play network adapter, the driver fails to load or is unable to find the
adapter at the specified I/O address. However, if you restart Windows 95 and
choose "Safe mode command prompt only" from the Startup menu, you can load LSL
and 3C5X9.COM without errors.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Windows 95 sets the adapter to Plug and Play mode
before the 3C5X9.COM driver is loaded. Because the 3C509B adapter is a Plug and
Play adapter, Windows 95 attempts to enumerate the adapter along with the other
Plug and Play devices on the system during the boot process. The enumeration
process sets the adapter to Plug and Play mode, causing it to no longer maintain
its manually specified hardware settings. This causes the driver to fail to
locate the adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the 3C509B configuration utility to disable support
for Plug and Play when using an ODI driver.

NOTE: You can also disable Plug and Play for the 3C509B adapter by obtaining the
latest EtherDisk (version 4.2) for the Etherlink III and running the
PNPDSABL.BAT file located in the root directory of the disk. For more
information about the 3Com Etherlink III or 3Com utilities, contact 3Com.
