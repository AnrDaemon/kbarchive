TITLE   :Applications Hang When Opening Files when CSNW is Installed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51, start Client Services for NetWare (CSNW), and
run an application that opens files on the network, the application may stop
responding (hang). Also, if a drive is redirected to point to the local drive,
and the application opens files on the redirected drive, the application may
hang. For example, if you use SUBST to redirect the C:\TEST directory to drive
Z:, the application may hang when it opens files on drive Z. Once the problem
occurs, any NET USE command will also hang.


RESOLUTION
----------

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already done
so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

STATUS
------
