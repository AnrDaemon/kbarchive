PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a shortcut to an MS-DOS-based program (.com, .exe, or .bat
file) on a network drive that has been disconnected, you receive the following
error message:

   Cannot find the working folder for this program. The program may have
   difficulty locating its files and documents. Make sure that the working
   folder is specified correctly in the property sheets for the program and any
   shortcuts to it. Do you wish to run the program anyway?

If you click Yes, you receive the following error message:

   Cannot find the file <drive>:\<path>\<program file>

This problem does not occur with shortcuts to Windows-based programs or
registered file types.

CAUSE
=====

Windows 95 does not correctly remap the network drive before trying to run the
MS-DOS-based program specified in the shortcut.


RESOLUTION
==========

Remap the network drive containing the MS-DOS-based program file using the same
drive letter, or change the shortcut to use a UNC path. UNC paths have the
following syntax:

   \\<servername>\<sharename>\<path>\<program file>
