SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore a full-system backup, it may appear that the desktop pattern,
the wallpaper, and the screen saver have not been restored.

CAUSE
=====

The last process of the restore operation is to merge the registry settings from
the backup into the current registry. Once this process is completed, the
registry contains the desktop settings from the backup files, and you must
restart the computer so that the settings can be loaded into memory. If you do
not restart the computer promptly, Windows may automatically update the registry
with the previous desktop settings by overwriting the changes made during the
restore operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart the computer as quickly as possible after the restore operation is
completed; however, follow the proper shut-down procedures.
