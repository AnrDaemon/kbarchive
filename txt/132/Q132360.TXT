When you set up a program item in Windows NT, and uses a directory name
that contains a space in either the Command Line or Working Directory
text boxes, the following error appears:

   The path <drive letter>:\<xxx> is invalid.

where <drive letter> is the root drive letter and <xxx> represents the
portion of the directory name that precedes the space.

Directory names that include a space must be enclosed with quotation marks
when used in the Command Line and Working Directory text boxes. If you
choose the Browse button and select the directory from the Browse dialog
box, the quotation marks are added automatically.
