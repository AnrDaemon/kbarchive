SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Calculator tool, you may receive an incorrect result if you
multiply, divide, add, or subtract after using the percent (%) key.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the percent key followed by an operator, Calculator performs a
multiplication operation regardless of which operator you use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows versions 3.1
and 3.11, Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5, and Microsoft Windows
95/98.

MORE INFORMATION
