TITLE   :FIX:Hard-coded breakpoints and RtlGetUserInfoHeap error
PRODUCT :Microsoft C Compiler
PROD/VER::2.1,2.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDatabase kbMFC kbODBC kbVCkbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to a 32-bit SQL Server ODBC data source while running the VC++
debugger under Windows NT 3.51, you may receive messages in the Ouptut window
similar to the messages below:

   

   LDR: LdrpMapDll Relocating: Base Name odbccp32.dll
   LDR: LdrpMapDll Relocating: Base Name sqlsrv32.dll
   LDR: LdrpMapDll Relocating: Base Name MSVCRT10.dll
   LDR: LdrpMapDll Relocating: Base Name dbnmpntw.DLL
   HEAP: Invalid Address specified to RtlGetUserInfoHeap( 140000, 145aec )

These messages will occur if you are using the SQL Server 4.21 ODBC driver.

Additionally, you may find that the debugger will stop on hard-coded breakpoints
(INT 3 assembler instructions).

RESOLUTION
==========

The messages are harmless and can be ignored. After hitting the breakpoints, you
can continue by selecting "GO" in the debugger or pressing F5. The Microsoft SQL
Server ODBC version 2.50.0121 fixes the problem. You can acquire the latest
version of the SQL Server ODBC driver on the SQL Server version 6.0 CD in the
\I386\ODBC directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products mentioned at the
beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in version 2.50.0121 of
the SQL Server ODBC driver.
