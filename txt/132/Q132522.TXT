The quickest and easiest troubleshooting step to take when trying to solve
Directory Replicator problems is to assign a new user name to the Directory
Replicator service. To do this:

1. Run User Manager for Domains and choose New User from the User menu.

2. In the Username field type a user name, such as ReplAcct.

3. Run Control Panel and choose Services.

4. Select the Directory Replicator service and choose Stop if the service is
   running.

5. With the Directory Replicator service selected, choose Startup.

6. In the Log On As: section, choose the browse button with the three dots to
   the right of the This Account field.

7. Choose the user name you created in step 1 and choose Add. The Add Name field
   below should display:

   <domain_name>\ReplAcct

   where <domain_name> is your domain's name.

8. Choose OK twice. A message box displays the following:

   The account <domain_name>\ReplAcct has been granted the Log On As A
   Service right and added to the Replicator local group.

9. Now choose Start to start the Directory Replicator service.
