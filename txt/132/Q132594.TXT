SYMPTOMS
========

When you print text with a personalized font created by Signature Software, text
formatted with a "running-hand" font may not be printed as it should be.
"Running-hand" fonts are designed to resemble your handwriting.

CAUSE
=====

Signature Software ships a TrueType version as well as a PostScript version of
these personalized fonts. However, they specify different character sets for
these fonts. The TrueType version is marked ANSI and the PostScript version is
marked Symbol. The PostScript font mapper chooses the TrueType version for
printing.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the program from which you are printing is character set-aware, specify the
Symbol character set for the font before printing.

If the program is not character set-aware, remove the TrueType font in the Fonts
folder. This causes the fonts displayed on the screen to be in the Symbol
character set. You can use a different font while you are typing the text and
then change the font before you print the document.
