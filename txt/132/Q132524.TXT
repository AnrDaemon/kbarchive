TITLE   :Popup Message Queue Can Only Receive 6 Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2000; winnt:3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
 - Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The messenger service accepts and displays at the most six messages. If it
receives more than six messages, and if the previous messages are not
acknowledged (by choosing the OK button in the popup window), all messages sent
after the sixth message are ignored and not displayed.

This can also show up with other combinations of messages and confirmations, such
as in the following transaction example:

   Sent                  Acknowledged  Displayed
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   NET SEND USER1 Test1  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test2  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test3  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test4  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test5  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test6  None          Yes
   NET SEND USER1 Test7  None          No
   <Nothing Sent>        Test1         N/A
   NET SEND USER1 Test8  None          Yes (Test7 not displayed)
   NET SEND USER1 Test9  None          No

CAUSE
=====

The maximum queue size for the messenger service is hardcoded to five (starting
at zero).


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, acknowledge each message as it appears by choosing
OK, to prevent the message queue from reaching its maximum size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
