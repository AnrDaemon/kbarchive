SUMMARY
=======

The term process is a multitasking concept used in Windows 95 and Windows NT. A
process represents a running instance of an application. It has resources such
as files, memory, and threads. A thread represents a single path of execution of
the process. In Windows 95 and Windows NT, an application can spawn multiple
threads by calling the Win32API function CreateThread().

Under Windows 95 and Windows NT, Visual FoxPro exists in two threads. All
applications created in Visual FoxPro also exist in two threads, and there is no
Visual FoxPro command or operation that spawns an additional thread. Explicitly
calling the CreateThread API function via the DECLARE-DLL command from a program
creates a thread, but Visual FoxPro code won't execute in that thread;
therefore, it is not recommended.

Because Win32s does not support multiple threads for a single process, Visual
FoxPro exists in one thread in Windows and Windows for Workgroups.
