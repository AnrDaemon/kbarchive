======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Samsung 2412 printer in conjunction with Windows or Windows for
Workgroups, you may experience the following symptoms:

 - Blurry text or graphics near the the top of the printout.

 - Characters that may not be printed or that are cut off.

NOTE: The Samsung 2412 does not have its own Windows 3.x printer driver, so you
must use the Epson LQ800 or LQ850 printer driver.

CAUSE
=====

The Samsung 2412 printer may require a "logic board" upgrade to work properly
with Windows 3.1x. This upgrade (fix) is available through an authorized Samsung
Service Center.

RESOLUTION
==========

Samsung has confirmed that some of the Samsung 2412 model printers encounter the
above symptoms without the logic board upgrade.

Contact Samsung Technical Support for more information concerning warranty
service for the printer at (800)446-0262.
