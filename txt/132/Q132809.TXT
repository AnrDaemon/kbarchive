The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Suspend command on the Start menu, the screen goes blank, but
the computer does not suspend.

CAUSE
=====

Some computer models have system extensions that enable Windows 95 to perform
basic power management tasks, such as querying power status. When you click
Suspend, Windows 95 calls one of these extensions and tries to suspend the
computer. However, some computer models ignore this request and do nothing
because the computer cannot actually suspend.

RESOLUTION
==========

If nothing happens when you click Suspend, you may want to remove the command
from the Start menu. To remove the command, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Power icon.

3. In the Suspend Command Options area, select Never for the "Show Suspend
   Command On Start Menu" option.
