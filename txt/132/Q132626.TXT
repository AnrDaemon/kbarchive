PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdisplay kbenv win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an S3 video adapter with a resolution higher than 1024 x 768
x 256 colors or any resolution with more than 256 colors, the mouse pointer may
disappear.

CAUSE
=====

The S3 video driver has two sources for generating the pointer. The driver can
use either the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) on the adapter or the S3 chip
itself. The S3 driver uses the appropriate source based on the color depth and
resolution.
The problem described in this article can occur if the DAC on the adapter is not
working correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use software pointers instead of hardware pointers.
To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. On the Performance tab, click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Accelerator slider one notch to the left (to the Most
   Accelerator Functions setting).

5. Click OK.
