TITLE   :PC WSPlus: Loss of Description Data After a Carriage Return
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:1.0,1.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use version 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, the data
in the description field of an appointment on the sender's calendar appears to
get truncated when it is written to the recipient's calendar.

For example, User A invites User B to a meeting. User A fills in a description of
"Sales meeting in room 1," and presses the ENTER key to skip to the next
physical line. Then, User A types "Please bring project updates." User B
receives the invitation and accepts it. The appointment is written to User B's
calendar. However, only "Sales meeting in room 1" appears in the description
field.

CAUSE
=====

In Microsoft Schedule+, an appointment can be composed of multiple lines
separated by carriage returns. However, only the data before the first carriage
return will be the subject of the invite message.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior is by design.
