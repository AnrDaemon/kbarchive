SYMPTOMS
========

A user without sufficient rights to add items in the SourceSafe database can do
so with the Drag/drop from File Manager option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
This bug was corrected in Visual SourceSafe version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To duplicate this problem:

1. Create a user in the SSADMIN utility with only RC rights on the $/ project.

2. Start Visual SourceSafe as that user.

3. Drag a subdirectory from the right-hand pane of File Manager and drop on the
   $/ project on the left-hand pane.

4. The project will be successfully added even though the user does not have
   sufficient rights to add items into the Visual SourceSafe database.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is no way to work around for this problem in Visual SourceSafe 3.1. Obtain
Visual SourceSafe 4.0 to work around the problem.
