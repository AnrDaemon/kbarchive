======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The ClassWizard, used with:
    - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows 
    - Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use ClassWizard to map a drop list combobox to a foreign CRecordset
object's field through a record view integer member variable, ClassWizard
generates a call to DDX_FieldCBIndex in the record view's DoDataExchange()
member function:

      void CMyRecordView::DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX)
      {
         ...
         //{{AFX_DATA_MAP(CMyRecordView)
         DDX_FieldCBIndex(pDX, IDC_COMBO1, m_pSet->m_id, m_pSet);
         //}}AFX_DATA_MAP
      }

When compiling the program, the compiler gives you the following compiler error:

   error C2065: 'DDX_FieldCBIndex' : undeclared identifier

CAUSE
=====

The DDX_FieldCBIndex function is not implemented by the Microsoft Foundation
Classes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not bind the integer data member of the record view to a drop down combo box.
Bind the data member to an edit control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was fixed in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit Edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When implementing CRecordView and CRecordSet classes, ClassWizard completes two
data exchanges. Data is exchanged between the record view control and the record
view data members and between it and the record set data members, which are
linked to the database fields.

                  RFX                          DDX

    Data          Record                       Dynamic
    Source  <---- Field   --->   record   <--- Data --->   controls
    record        Exchange       view          Exchange
    set

For record view data members that have a corresponding database field, the
DDX_Fieldxxx set of functions are used to perform DDX. For those members without
corresponding database fields, the DDX_xxx set of functions are used. For every
DDX_xxx function, there is typically a corresponding DDX_Fieldxxx function.

The corresponding data exchange function for DDX_FieldCBIndex() is DDX_CBIndex(),
which obtains the index position of the item in the listbox portion of the
combobox. This information is meaningless outside of the combo box unless it
corresponds to a predefined string. If this is the case, then the data member
should be bound to an edit control.
