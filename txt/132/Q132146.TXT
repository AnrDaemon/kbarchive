The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dogs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some video configurations cause Microsoft Dogs movie clips to drop frames and
appear choppy and jumpy. The problem is most noticeable with screen resolutions
set to 640x480 with 16.7 million colors.

This article lists some of those configurations.

MORE INFORMATION

Zenith Z-6 49                      TIGA 640x480x256

Though the problems usually remain when you use fewer colors in 640x480
resolution, higher resolutions, such as 600x800 or 1024x768 may provide some
improvement.
