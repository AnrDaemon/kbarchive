SYMPTOMS
========

Encarta animations that have previously worked, fail to play.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if components of Encarta have been moved to other folders or hard
drives since installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Move the Encarta Projector to the drive where Encarta was originally installed.
This should be the startup (drive that contains the system folder) drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Encarta installs to the startup drive on a Macintosh. When components are moved
after installation, Encarta has difficulty locating the components. Encarta and
the Animation Launcher are unable to play animations without Encarta Projector.
