TITLE   :Applications Run From the AT Schedule Service Cannot Print
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you start an application using the AT Schedule service with the Interactive
switch, the application's printers are disabled. If the application tries to
print automatically at startup using a macro, printing fails and some
applications (for example, Word For Windows 6.0 and Write) display an error
message indicating the printer is not configured properly or not present.

WORKAROUND
==========

No workaround is available if you are running 16-bit applications from the AT
Schedule service.

If you are running 32-bit applications:

 - Setup the printers with an administrator account and save the user profile:

   1. Log on as administrator and setup the printers.

   2. Use the Windows NT Server User Profile editor or the Windows NT Resource
      Kit User Profile editor (under Windows NT Workstation) and save the
      current profile as System and User Default.

   3. Restart the system so that the changes will take effect.

-or-

 - Use an administrative user account instead of the System Account for the
   Schedule service. To change the settings:

   1. Run Control Panel and choose Services.

   2. Select Schedule and then choose Startup.

   3. Select This Account and then use an account that has administrative
      privileges.

   4. Supply the correct password and confirm it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
