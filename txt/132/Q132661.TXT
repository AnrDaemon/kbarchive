TITLE   :Some Multimedia Titles Do Not Work on HP Vectra Communication
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to play the audio tracks on mixed-mode compact discs on a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) Vectra Communication computer.

CAUSE
=====

HP Vectra Communication computers incorporate a DSP-based combination
sound/modem/fax/CD-ROM controller card that cannot play the audio tracks on a
mixed-mode compact disc.

Multimedia titles that include audio CD tracks in their sounds do not play
correctly on these computers. Some games (such as Sound It Out Land by Conexus)
do not progress beyond the opening screen. Other games may display error
messages similar to the following:

   MMSYSTEM 262 There is a problem with your media device. Make sure it is
   working properly or contact the device manufacturer.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to work around this problem by using the computer's original
real-mode drivers. Note that doing so will result in slight degradation in
system performance. To use the real-mode drivers, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
   double-click the System icon.

2. On the Device Manager tab, double-click the SCSI controller branch, and then
   double-click "Adaptec AIC-6x60 ISA Single Chip Controller."

3. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it.

4. Click OK.

5. Add the following lines to the Config.sys file:

   device=c:\hp_iobrd\adaptec\aspi2dos.sys
   device=c:\hp_iobrd\adaptec\aspicd.sys /d:aspicd0

6. Remove the semicolon from the beginning of the Mscdex entry and then save and
   close the Config.sys file.

7. Add the following line to the Autoexec.bat file:

   c:\windows\command\mscdex.exe /d:aspicd0

   NOTE: This line may require modification to work with your computer.

8. Restart your computer.
