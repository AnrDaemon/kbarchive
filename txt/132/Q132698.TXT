The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dogs for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Oceans for Windows, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft World of Flight for Windows, version 1.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a wallpaper image from within one of the programs listed at the
top of this article, the size of the file is 0 bytes and the wallpaper is not
saved.

CAUSE
=====

If you don't have enough hard disk space when you click Make Wallpaper, no error
message appears. Instead, the program creates a 0 byte-sized file in the Windows
folder named Msdogs.bmp, Msoceans.bmp or Msflight.bmp, depending on the
application in use.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make additional hard disk space available, then click Make Wallpaper.
