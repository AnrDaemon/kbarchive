TITLE   :Error Message: Rundll32 Caused a GPF in Apmext.dll
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Power icon in Windows 95 Control Panel on a NEC Versa
computer, you may receive the following error message:

   Rundll32 Caused a General Protection Fault in Apmext.dll

CAUSE
=====

NEC includes a custom power management dynamic-link library (dll) file named
Apmext.dll with Windows 3.x on some of its Versa laptops. This dll is hard-coded
to the Microsoft-supplied Windows 3.x Power applet in Control Panel. The
Apmext.dll file is not compatible with Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, remove the following line from the [Power.drv]
section of the System.ini file:

   OptionsDll=apmext.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Apmext.dll file tries to dynamically add a second battery meter status bar
to the Power applet display in Control Panel. The Windows 95 Power applet is
different from the Windows 3.x version, causing the Apmext.dll file to cause a
general protection fault when it tries to modify the dialog.

Versa computers are manufactured by NEC, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
