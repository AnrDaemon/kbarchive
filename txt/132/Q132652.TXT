TITLE   :Pressing ESC Key May Cause Garbled Startup Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows 95, the Startup screen (text mode) may be displayed
incorrectly. If you press the ESC key to view the text-mode screen, the
characters may seem garbled.

CAUSE
=====

Some types of video adapters cannot properly handle the video mode switching
that occurs when you press the ESC key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, add the following line to the [Options] section of the
Msdos.sys file:

   Logo=0

This line prevents the Windows 95 logo from being displayed at startup, allowing
the text-mode screen to be displayed correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Msdos.sys file has its hidden and read-only attributes set. You must clear
these attributes before you can edit the file.

You may also need to use the "Logo=0" switch in the Msdos.sys file if a batch
file that prevents starting protected mode is called from the Autoexec.bat file.
