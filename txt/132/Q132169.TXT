======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to connect to a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 RAS server with a Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 RAS client, and you have selected Require Data Encryption,
the following error appears:

   NETBIOS error 640: a netbios error has occurred (with failed code 0xa)

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 was released before the development of RAS
data encryption in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51. Because Windows for
Workgroups RAS cannot negotiate this encryption it displays the error.

For information on other causes of Error 640, see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the "Require data encryption" option under the Encryption settings in
the Network Configuration dialog of the Remote Access Setup window. Click
Configure after you select Remote Access Service in Control Panel Network to
view the Network Configuration dialog.
