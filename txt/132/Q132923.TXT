======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for MS-DOS, version 3.1 
 - Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the two methods of sharing projects in SourceSafe. In
addition, the article shows how to identify shared projects and how they are
shared.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you share Projects, SourceSafe shares all of the files in the project and
its subprojects if you select recursive.

While the multiple pages icon indicates that a file has been shared, you may
forget where the file is located in other projects. The LINKS command can
display the locations of the shared file in other projects.

Example 1 - Sharing the most recent version of the project
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Highlight the Location where you want to move the project. For this example,
   suppose we create a new project in the $/ (root) project.

2. Select Share from the SourceSafe menu.

3. Highlight the $/<orig. project> project in the Projects: list box.

4. Select the Share push button.

5. Type the <new project> in the New Name text box.

6. Select the Recursive check box.

7. Select OK.

Example 2 - Sharing a specific version of a project
---------------------------------------------------

You can also select a specific version of a project from the history window. The
only difference between sharing a specific version of a file and sharing a
specific version of a project is the dialog that allows you to select where you
want to share the project.
