TITLE   :Doc Err: Attachmate Extra for Windows Requires IPXINTFC TSR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 5 of the Windows NT Services for NetWare Networks help file
(NETWARE.HLP) includes a subtopic titled "Special Considerations for
Individual NetWare-Aware Applications." It states the following:

   Attachmate Extra for Windows requires IPXINTFC, a terminate-
   and-stay-resident (TSR) utility. This TSP must be loaded by AUTOEXEC.NT prior
   to the DOSX TSR being loaded.

   For example, suppose Attachmate Extra! for Windows has been loaded in the
   C:\EXTRAWIN subdirectory. In AUTOEXEC.NT, make sure the following three lines
   are in the order shown:

   lh c:\extrawin\ipxintfc REM Install DPMI support lh winnt\system32\dosx

After you follow the instructions and load the IPXINTFC TSR required by
Attachmate for IPX/SPX connectivity and ensure the IPX/SPX Compatible
Transport is installed on the computer, an error message indicating that
IPX is not loaded appears.

To correct this problem, use Attachmate Extra! for Windows version 4.1 (or
later) or Attachmate Extra! for Windows NT version 1.0 (or later). These
versions do not require a TSP for IPX connectivity.
