The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows by example how to find another occurrence of a string in a
file (Find Again) when the CTRL+G key combination is pressed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In FoxPro version 2.x, the Find dialog is activated by pressing CTRL+F. To find
another occurrence of a string in a text file, you can press CTRL+G key, and a
new search is performed.

Visual FoxPro uses a Find dialog common to Windows-based applications on a
specific platform. With this dialog, pressing CTRL+G no longer performs a "Find
Again" operation. You can, however, program this functionality by explicitly
calling the Find window when CTRL+G is pressed.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

The following example code illustrates this method. To execute the sample code,
follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the code into a program (.PRG) file named FINDAGN.

2. Run the program by typing "DO FINDAGN" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Command window.

3. Open a text file, and press CTRL+F. The Find dialog is activated. Type a
   string that reoccurs in the text file.

4. Press CTRL+G to find the string again.

Code Sample
-----------

   * : Find Again for Visual FoxPro using Ctrl+G.
   *  Parameter List....: tlFindMode

   *-- To execute Find Again, press {Ctrl+G}.

   LPARAMETERS tlFindMode
   LOCAL lcDoCommand

   *-- If not find mode, initialize {Ctrl+G}.
   IF NOT tlFindMode
     lcDoCommand='DO '+SYS(16)+' WITH .T.'
     ON KEY LABEL Ctrl+G &lcDoCommand
     RETURN
   ENDIF

   *-- If Find dialog is not active, stuff keyboard with {Ctrl+F} and
   *   stuff {ENTER} in keyboard to execute Find.
   IF NOT WEXIST('Find')
     KEYBOARD '{Ctrl+F}{ENTER}' PLAIN
     RETURN
   ENDIF

   *-- Activate Find dialog window and stuff {ENTER} in keyboard to
   *   execute Find.
   ACTIVATE WINDOW Find
   KEYBOARD '{ENTER}' PLAIN

   RETURN
