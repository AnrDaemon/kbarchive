SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a desktop wallpaper from a network drive, the wallpaper you
select may not be loaded when you restart your computer. Instead, your desktop
has a solid color.

CAUSE
=====

If you select a wallpaper while you are working on a secure network resource,
the wallpaper bitmap is not accessible until you enter a password. However, the
wallpaper is loaded before you log in. Depending on the system configuration,
the system may not attempt to reload the wallpaper you selected after the you
have entered a password.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

1. Copy the wallpaper bitmap file to your local hard drive and specify the local
   copy in the Display tool in Control Panel. This ensures that the wallpaper is
   accessible when you start your computer.

2. In the Password Properties dialog box, make sure the second option, that
   users can customize their desktop settings, is checked so that the next time
   you log on, your settings are restored.
