SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microprose Fleet Defender F14 Simulation in Windows
95, you may receive the following error message if another program is already
using MIDI:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be terminated. Quit
   all programs, and then restart your computer.

CAUSE
=====

When it starts, Fleet Defender F14 Simulation attempts to acquire the system's
internal MIDI hardware that is virtualized in Windows 95. The above error
message is caused by a conflict between the hardware detection routine initiated
by Fleet Defender F14 Simulation and the virtualization algorithm used by
Windows 95.


RESOLUTION
==========

Before you start Fleet Defender F14 Simulation, make sure that no other programs
are using MIDI.
