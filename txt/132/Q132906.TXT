SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a Plug and Play BIOS, you may not be able to configure in
Device Manager a device that has been disabled in the BIOS, even though the BIOS
supports configuring devices for the next time the computer starts.

When you click the device in Device Manager and then click Properties, you see
the following message in the Status box:

   The device has been disabled in the hardware. In order to use this
   device, you must re-enable the hardware. See your hardware
   documentation for details. (Code 29.)

CAUSE
=====

Device Manager does not allow resources to be allocated to devices that are
disabled in the BIOS, even if the BIOS supports configuring devices for the next
time the computer starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

Enable the device in the BIOS before you try to configure it in Device Manager.
For information about enabling devices in the BIOS, please contact your computer
vendor or manufacturer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
