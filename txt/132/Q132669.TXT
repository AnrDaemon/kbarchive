SYMPTOMS
========

Text or brush objects that print as blue on a Canon printer in Windows version
3.1, print as purple in Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

Several models in the Canon Bubble Jet series use CMY inks that, when mixed in
the conventional proportions (equal parts cyan and magenta) do not produce the
expected blue color. Instead they produce a definite purple color.

The Canon printer driver that shipped with Windows 3.1 has a special color
setting (Match Screen Colors) that causes the driver to remap the specified
color to a new color that, when printed, appears to be more blue. This new color
uses only 40% magenta instead of the normal 100%. The Canon driver default color
setting also prints blue text and brushes as purple.

The Unidrv.dll does not currently provide color adjustment functionality.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Canon for an updated printer driver for Windows 95.
