-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In previous versions of FoxPro for Windows, the attributes of the main FoxPro
desktop screen could be manipulated using the MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN command.
Although this method still works in Visual FoxPro, the preferred version 3.0
method is to change the properties of the _SCREEN system memory variable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the _SCREEN system memory variable in conjunction with the
appropriate property to change specific attributes of the main FoxPro desktop
screen. The following line of code changes the caption or title of the main
FoxPro desktop screen:

      _SCREEEN.Caption="New Title"

You can use this method to change any of the available properties for the _SCREEN
system memory variable. Use the AMEMBERS() function to obtain a list of the
available properties for this object. For example, the following line of code
loads the SCRNPROPS array with all the available properties, methods, and events
for the main FoxPro desktop screen:

      =AMEMBERS(SCRNPROPS,_SCREEN,1)

Examine the SCRNPROPS array to see all the available properties, methods, and
events. The second column of the array indicates whether the item is a property,
method, or event.
