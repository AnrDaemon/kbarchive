SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up Quattro Pro version 6.0 from disks on a computer running Windows
version 3.1 and choose a NetWare mapped network drive as the destination drive,
Windows 3.1 prompts you to choose whether to set up Quattro Pro as a shared
network installation on the server, or to set up Quattro Pro on a local hard
drive. This prompt appears just after the setup page that asks for the
installation path.

In Windows 95, this prompt does not appear, so that the program is always set up
as a single-user installation.

CAUSE
=====

The Quattro Pro Setup program is looking for a Windows 3.x line in the [boot]
section of the System.ini file that is removed by Windows 95 Setup. The line in
the [boot] section reads as follows:

      [boot]
      SecondNet.drv=netware.drv

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the behavior, add the line

      SecondNet.drv=netware.drv

to the [boot] section of the System.ini file. The addition of this line does not
seem to have any adverse effects on the proper operation of Windows 95.
