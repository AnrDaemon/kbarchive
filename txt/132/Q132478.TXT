TITLE   :PRB: Grid Column's CurrentControl Reverts to Text1 Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SQL SELECT command, and set the grid's RecordSource property to
the newly queried cursor file, the grid column's current control (Check1 for
example) reverts to Text1 (the default control).

CAUSE
=====

The SQL SELECT code includes a SELECT ... INTO CURSOR TESTCURSOR command, which
is the RecordSource for the grid. When this happens, the original cursor must be
destroyed before the new cursor can be created. When the orginal cursor is
destroyed, the grid columns and the controls in the columns are also destroyed,
as well as the check box. In this case, the check box is destroyed. The SQL
SELECT code sets the grid's RecordSource to the new cursor. At this point, the
columns are automatically created with the default settings. There is no code to
recreate the check box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To retain the controls in the grid columns, add the following statement prior to
executing the SQL SELECT command:

         THISFORM.Grid1.RecordSource = ""

For more information, please see the example workaround in the More Information
section of this article.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Issue the following commands:

      CREATE TABLE Testdbf (id N(1), region C(10))
      INSERT INTO Testdbf VALUES (0, "North")
      INSERT INTO Testdbf VALUES (1, "South")
      INSERT INTO Testdbf VALUES (0, "North")
      INSERT INTO Testdbf VALUES (1, "South")

2. Create a form named Test.

3. Add the Testdbf table to the Test form's Data Environment.

4. Drag the Testdbf table to the form. A grid is added to the form.

5. Set the following PEMs (properties, events, and methods) for the grid:

      .ColumnCount = 2
      .RecordSource = "testcursor"

6. Select Grid1.Column1 in the Properties window.

7. Click the check box tool on the toolbar. On the grid, Check1 should appear
   under Grid1.Column1 in the Properties window.

8. Change the Grid1.Column1.CurrentControl property to Check1.

9. Add a text box to the form.

10. Add a command button to the form, and set the following PEMs:

       .Caption = "SQL"
       .Click
          SELECT * FROM Testdbf ;
             WHERE region = ALLTRIM(thisform.text1.value) ;
             INTO CURSOR testcursor
          THISFORM.Grid1.RecordSource = "testcursor"
          THISFORM.Grid1.SetFocus

11. In the Form1.Load event, add this line of code:

       SELECT * FROM Testdbf WHERE region = "North" ;
          INTO CURSOR testcursor

12. Save and run form. The grid is populated with "North" records only, and
   Grid1.Column1 displays a check box.

13. Type "South" (without the quotation marks) in the text box.

14. Click the SQL button.

15. Widen the ID column. The grid is populated with the "South" records only,
   and Grid1.Column1 no longer displays a check box control. It now displays
   the default control, which is a text box with a value of 1 for both records.

Example Workaround
------------------

1. Modify the Test form.

2. In the Command1.Click event, add the following statement prior to executing
   the SQL SELECT command:

         THISFORM.Grid1.RecordSource = ""

   For example:

         THISFORM.Grid1.RecordSource = ""
         SELECT * FROM Testdbf ;
            WHERE region = ALLTRIM(thisform.text1.value) ;
            INTO CURSOR testcursor
         THISFORM.Grid1.RecordSource = "testcursor"
         THISFORM.Grid1.SetFocus

3. Type the "CLEAR ALL" (without the quotation marks) command in the Command
   window.

4. Save and run the form.

5. Type "South" (without the quotation marks) in the text box.

6. Click the SQL button. Now the grid is populated with the "South" records
   only, and Grid1.Column1 redisplays the check box control.
