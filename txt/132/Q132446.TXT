SYMPTOMS
========

When you add more than 150 users or groups using Add Users for Windows NT
(ADDUSERS.EXE), the following error messages appear:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   SERVICES.EXE (and LSASS.EXE)

   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005)


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the size of the change log is too small to handle
requests by ADDUSERS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, modify the Registry on all domain controllers before
setting up new user or group accounts using ADDUSERS.EXE:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

      \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon\Parameters

3. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value.

4. Add the following:

      Value Name: ChangeLogSize
      Data Type:  REG_DWORD
      String:     0x400000 (Hex)

5. Choose OK and quit Registry Editor.

6. Shutdown and restart Windows NT.
