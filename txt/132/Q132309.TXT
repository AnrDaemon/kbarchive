SYMPTOMS
========

If you press ALT+TAB to switch away from a Wizard, you cannot switch back to the
Wizard by pressing ALT+TAB again. If you are not using a mouse or the mouse is
not currently functioning, there does not appear to be any way to switch back to
the Wizard.

CAUSE
=====

Wizards do not appear in the task list that appears when you press ALT+TAB
because they are not executable programs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the ALT+ESC key combination to switch to the Wizard, or click the Wizard
with the mouse.
