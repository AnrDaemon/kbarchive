======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to reinstall or upgrade the copy of Windows 95 on an IBM Aptiva 710
computer, you may receive the following error message while Setup is analyzing
the computer:

   Setup: Error SU0507

   The following problem occurred while Setup was analyzing your computer:
   SDMErr(8037001b): Detection function returned a DMS error.
   DMSError: This computer cannot be upgraded from Windows. Please shutdown
   Windows and upgrade in MS-DOS mode.

   Setup cannot continue and will now close.

If you restart the computer in MS-DOS mode and try to install Windows 95, you may
receive a general protection (GP) fault error message during the detection
portion of Setup. If you ignore this error message, Setup continues and finishes
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When you run Setup from within Windows 95, the computer's BIOS prevents Setup
from reliably detecting all the installed hardware in the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Restart your computer in MS-DOS mode and then run Setup. If you receive a GP
fault error message, ignore the error message and continue.

For information about a possible BIOS upgrade to eliminate this problem, please
contact IBM.
