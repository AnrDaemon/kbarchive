======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the File Type dialog box to change a file's association, the new
association may not take effect; that is, it may revert to its old association.

CAUSE
=====

The new association may not take effect because of slightly corrupted file type
information in the registry that the File Types dialog box does not handle
properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the File Types dialog box, first remove the old association completely, and
then add the new association.
