TITLE   :Cannot Play Wave Files on HP Vectra with Sound Blaster
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to play 8-bit wave (.wav) files on a Hewlett-Packard (HP)
Vectra computer with a Sound Blaster sound card installed. When this problem
occurs, you can play 16-bit wave files and MIDI file correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a resource conflict between the sound card and the
ECP port. On the HP Vectra computer, the ECP port is configured in the
computer's CMOS settings. If the ECP port is configured in the computer's CMOS
settings to use DMA channel 1, and the Sound Blaster sound card is also
configured to use DMA channel 1, a resource conflict exists. However, Windows 95
cannot detect that the ECP port is using DMA channel 1, and does not report that
a conflict exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the conflict, change the DMA channel for the sound card. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. On the Device Manager tab, double-click Sound, Video, And Game Controllers.

4. Double-click the Sound Blaster sound card.

5. On the Resources tab, click the Use Automatic Settings check box to clear it.

6. Click Direct Memory Access in the Resource Type column, then click Change
   Setting.

7. Click OK until you are prompted to restart your computer, then click Yes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs only on computers (such as the HP Vectra) that have an ECP
port that is configured in the computer's CMOS settings.
