TITLE   :Logon Scripts Run From Wrong Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a backup domain controller (BDC) or primary domain controller
(PDC) with an account from a trusted domain, and the user accounts profile calls
for Windows NT to run a login script, Windows NT searches for the login script
on both computers in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS
subdirectory.

For example, the account resides in the Master domain and the you are logging on
from a primary domain controller (PDC) or backup domain controller (BDC) in the
Resource domain. The user account profile in the Master domain calls for LOG.BAT
to be run. If the file is present, the PDC or BDC in Resource domain runs the
script correctly. However, if you are logging on from a domain controller (DC)
and the LOG.BAT file is not in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS
subdirectory on the validating PDC in Master domain, and the profile calls for
LOG.BAT to be run, Windows NT searches for the file in the trusting domain.

This causes problems when you use the complete trust model and all logon scripts
have the same name, but have different contents in each domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post any new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
