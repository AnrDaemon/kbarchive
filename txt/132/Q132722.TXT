TITLE   :Server Instability After Reboot Caused by NDIS Driver Problem
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT (especially multiprocessor computers) may stop
responding (hang) or display a STOP message, within a few minutes of the Windows
NT startup sequence after being rebooted.


CAUSE
=====

There is a problem is NDIS.SYS that causes Windows NT to attempt to close a
Windows NT file handle twice when NdisOpenFile and NdisCloseFile are called.
Closing a handle a second time causes undefined results. If the handle being
closed a second time is in use by another driver, the results are unpredictable,
but may include a system hang or STOP message.


The following network card drivers make calls to the NdisOpenFile and
NdisCloseFile APIs, and therefore may indirectly cause the symptoms mentioned
above.

ANDTOK.SYS
F30N3.SYS
F70N3.SYS
IRMATRAC.SYS
NCRTOK.SYS
MDGMPORT.SYS
NE3200.SYS
NETFLX.SYS
PCIMAC.SYS
PRONET16.SYS
TCTOKNT.SYS
UBNEI.SYS

NOTE: The problem is in NDIS, not in these drivers. They are listed here to help
identify systems that may exhibit the symptoms mentioned above.

RESOLUTION
----------

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already done
so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

NDIS.SYS was corrected to close the Windows NT file handle only once.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
