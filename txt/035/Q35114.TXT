TITLE   :PRB: Comparison of a Constant and a Relocatable Is Not Allowed
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a,6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The comparison of a constant and a relocatable is not allowed. The following
example demonstrates three approaches to comparing a constant and a relocatable.
In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) 5.1 and 5.1a you will get the warning:

   warning A4031: Operand types must match

on the first of these approaches. In MASM 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b you will get the
error:

   error A2026: constant expected

on the first of these approaches, and you will get the error:

   error A2094: operand must be relocatable

on the second. The third approach, which turns the relocatable into a constant by
subtracting the beginning of the segment, will work.

CAUSE
=====

You can not compare a constant to a relocatable at assembly time because the
linker may change the value of the relocatable at link time.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is the expected behavior of MASM. The third approach in the example below
demonstrates the prefered way to compare a constant and a relocatable.

   a_var DW ?

   .ERRNZ 08000h LT a_var          ; constant LT relocatable
   .ERRNZ _DATA:08000h LT a_var    ; cast constant to relocatable
   .ERRNZ 08000h LT a_var- @CurSeg ; difference of relocatables
