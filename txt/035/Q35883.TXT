PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), version 5.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you assemble the following program with MASM version 5.1 and examine the
public label, TheProc, you will find an underscore prefixed to it. Another
symptom of the problem may occurs during link time. The linker will generate the
error L2029 unresolved external on public labels.

CAUSE
=====

The space before the comma in the structure initialization of Data1 causes the
problem to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Removing the space before the comma in the structure initialization of Data1
will allow you to work around the problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM version 5.1. This problem
was corrected in MASM version 5.1a.
