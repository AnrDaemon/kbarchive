The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

Using batch files in MS-DOS, it is not possible to include an equal
sign as an argument to a batch file. The batch file parser considers
this to be a delimiter, such as a space or tab character. Thus, using
the following one-line batch file (named TEST.BAT):

   echo %1 %2

If the following is entered:

   TEST one=two

it would produce the following output

   one two

which shows that the batch file parser considers "one" the first
argument, and "two" the second argument, with the equal sign being a
delimiter. This makes it impossible to enter equal signs in batch
files as command-line options.
