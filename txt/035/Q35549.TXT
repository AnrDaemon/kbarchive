SUMMARY
=======

When using Flight Simulator's World War I Ace mode, there are six enemy fighters
that stand ready to protect the enemy fuel depots and factories. If, after
shooting down all six enemy planes, you want to have more enemy planes appear,
you must fly over the river and back into friendly territory, then fly back into
enemy territory. Six new enemy planes will appear.

Flying back over friendly territory does not repair damage or refuel your plane,
so if you want to refuel or be repaired, you must land before reentering enemy
territory. Also, Friendly Base 2 has fuel only, so any time you need more bombs
you must return to Friendly Base 1.
