======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) versions 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b
real numbers can be initialized with a hexadecimal encoding by using the DD, DQ,
and DT directives. In MASM 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b real numbers can also be
initialized with a hexadecinal encoding by using the REAL4, REAL8, and REAL10
directives. The number of digits for encoded numbers declared with DD, DQ, and
DT or REAL4, REAL8, and REAL16 must be 8, 16, and 20 digits, respectively. If a
leading 0 is supplied, the number must be 9, 17, and 21 digits respectively.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example generates the warning:

   warning A4057: Illegal size for operand
   _DATA SEGMENT 'DATA'
   a_var DQ 000000000r
   _DATA ENDS
   END

MASM will correctly evaluate the constant, but the warning is telling the user
that the number of digits is not correct. The real number should be defined with
exactly 17 digits as in the following example.

      _DATA SEGMENT 'DATA'
      a_var DQ 00000000000000000r
      _DATA ENDS
      END
