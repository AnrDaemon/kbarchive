The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a 
 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On page 214, section 11.1.1, of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.1 Programmer's
Guide", the documentation indicates that the equal sign (=) directive may be
used with expressions that evaluate to an address. However, if the address
refers to an external label, MASM 5.1 and 5.1a will generate the error:

   error A2052: Improper operand type

MASM 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b will generate the error:

   error A2026: constant expected

CAUSE
=====

MASM has a restriction that the (=) directive can not be used on an external
address.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use the EQU directive to create an alias for an external address.
