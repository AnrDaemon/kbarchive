The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The NAME directive was available in MASM version 4.0. The directive, NAME
modulename, sets the name of the current module to modulename. A module name is
used by the linker when displaying error messages.

In MASM versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b the old directive does not
generate an assembler error so that the assembler provides downward
compatibility with MASM version 4.0 source files. The directive does not
generate any extra information for MASM versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, and
6.0b.

Additional query words: kbinf 5.00 5.10 5.10a 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
