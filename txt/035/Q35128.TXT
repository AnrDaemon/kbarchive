TITLE   :PRB: Line Parsing Order: Looks Up Second Token First
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::5.1,5.1a,6.0,6.0a,6.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 5.1, 5.1a, 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The example below will generate the warning:

   warning A4016: Reserved word used as symbol: MOV

when assembled with Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) 5.1 and 5.1a. This warning
is misleading. MASM 6.0, 6.0a, and 6.0b generate the more specific error
message:

   error A2001: immediate operand not allowed

CAUSE
=====

The reference to a_struc.a in the example below is a reference to a structure
template and not to a variable stored in memory. Thus, a_struc.a is a constant
or immediate operand. MASM 5.1 and 5.1a always looks up the second token on the
line first. In the case below, it sees "a_struc". Because a_struc is a structure
declaration, MASM assumes the line declares a structure instance with "MOV"
being the label. At this point, MASM errors on trying to use reserved symbol
"MOV" as a structure instance label.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is the expected behavior of MASM.
