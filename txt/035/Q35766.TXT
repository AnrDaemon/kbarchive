SUMMARY
=======

The FORMAT.COM utility supports two new switches, /N and /T. The /N switch
allows you to specify the number of tracks on the disk to be formatted.
Similarly, the /T switch allows you to specify the number of sectors per track
on the disk to be formatted. You must use the /T and /N switches together; you
cannot use them separately.

These are "open-ended" switches. That is, they do not work for all values, only
values that are supported by the ROM BIOS of your system. Specifying a value
that is not supported by the ROM BIOS results in the FORMAT.COM utility
returning the error "parameters not supported."
