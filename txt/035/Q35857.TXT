SYMPTOMS
========

When an application prints using the NEWFRAME escape on a banding device and
then tries to use a GDI function that is not supported in metafiles, the
function does not produce any output or produces incorrect output.

CAUSE
=====

Some GDI functions that work on the display fail on banding printers. When an
application prints using the NEWFRAME escape on a banding device, GDI diverts
each page to an intermediate metafile. This metafile is then played back to each
band on the device.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workaround is to use NEXTBAND instead of NEWFRAME on banding devices; in
this case, a metafile will not be used.

Note that some functions, such as the GetTextMetrics() function and similar types
of functions that do not attempt to produce output, do work correctly with
banding printer drivers because the call is directed to the printer driver, not
the intermediate metafile.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
