The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the FrontPage Server Extensions to a computer running Windows
NT Server 4.0, the following error occurs:

   Hidden console of wowvdm
   C:\Temp\. A temporary file needed for initialization could not be created or
   could not be written to. Make sure that the directory path exists and disk
   space is available. Choose Close to terminate the application

CAUSE
=====

The Temp directory does not exist or does not have sufficient permissions, or
there is not enough hard disk space available.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the C:\Temp directory exists, and the Everybody group has full
control of the folder. Free between 10-15 megabytes of hard drive space on the
drive that contains the Program Files folder. (You will need more if your html
content is stored on the same drive.)
