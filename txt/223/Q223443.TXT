The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips 2000

SUMMARY
=======

Because of physical read limitations of some CD-ROM drives, you may be denied
access to some of the files and folders on the Microsoft Expedia Streets and
Trips 2000 compact disc. This article lists those files and supplies a method to
test your CD-ROM drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To test for specific drive-capacity limitations, attempt to gain access to the
following files.

The Expedia Streets & Trips 2000 CD-ROM contains 620 MB of data. The final
file on the CD-ROM is Autousa7.exe.

NOTE: This list contains every file located on the Expedia Streets & Trips
2000 Run CD-ROM.

Testing Your CD-ROM Drive
-------------------------

To test the integrity of any files you copy from your CD-ROM drive to your hard
disk, compare the files using the MS-DOS File Compare program (Fc.exe). You can
use this test to determine if the CD-ROM subsystem is functioning properly at
the device driver or hardware level(s).

The Fc.exe program is a useful method for testing problems related to general
protection (GP) faults or other critical errors (such as read errors or out of
memory messages) that may occur when you use CD-ROM drives with Windows
programs.

To test your CD-ROM drive, attempt to copy one of these files to your hard disk.

For information about how to copy files in Windows, click Start, click Help,
click the Index tab, type "copying, files" (without the quotation marks), and
then click Display.

NOTE: If you are using Microsoft Windows 98, click Start, click Help, click the
Index tab, type "copying files, folders" (without the quotation marks), and then
click Display.

If you receive the following error message

   CDR101: Not Ready

the CD-ROM drive cannot read the disc at the specified location.

If the file is copied, test the file's integrity by using Fc.exe with the /B
(binary) switch. For example, to compare the Autousa7.exe file on the CD-ROM to
the Autousa7.exe file you copied to your hard disk, type the following line at
the MS-DOS command prompt, and then press ENTER

   fc /b <cd-rom>:\Autousa7.exe <drive>:\Autousa7.exe

where <cd-rom> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive, and <drive>
is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Streets and Trips 2000 is
installed.

If you receive errors, your CD-ROM drive is having problems reading the compact
disc at that location.
