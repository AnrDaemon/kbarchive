 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP4

SYMPTOMS
========

After Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 is installed on Far East versions of Windows
NT, custom forms cannot be used. The custom form can be created and selected as
the default paper size; however, when you try to use it through WordPad or
Microsoft Word, it is not selected as the default.

CAUSE
=====

This problem does not occur on the English version of Windows NT. Localization
of Rasdd.dll and Rasddui.dll may have left default document settings
uninitialized.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Windows NT
version 4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
