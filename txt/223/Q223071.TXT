MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard Exe project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the Hierarchical FlexGrid to the Visual Basic toolbox.

3. Place a Hierarchical FlexGrid and a CommandButton on the form.

4. Add the following code to the form:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       MsgBox "Clip = " & MSHFlexGrid1.Clip
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       With MSHFlexGrid1
           .Rows = 4
           .Cols = 4
           .Row = 0
           .Col = 0
           .RowSel = 3
           .ColSel = 3
           .Clip = vbTab & 1 & vbTab & 2 & vbTab & 3 & vbCr & _
                   1 & vbTab & 1 & vbTab & 2 & vbTab & 3 & vbCr & _
                   2 & vbTab & 2 & vbTab & 4 & vbTab & 6 & vbCr & _
                   3 & vbTab & 3 & vbTab & 6 & vbTab & 9
           .Row = 1
           .Col = 1
           .RowSel = 1
           .ColSel = 1
       End With
       Command1.Caption = "Clip"
   End Sub

5. Run the project.

6. Select some of the cells in the Hierarchical FlexGrid.

7. Click the Command button marked "Clip."

   If you're using the original version of the Hierarchical FlexGrid that shipped
   with Visual Basic 6.0 (MSHFLXGD.OCX version 6.00.3005) you will not see the
   contents of the selected cells in the dialog box. The Clip property will
   return an empty string.

With the version of the Hierarchical FlexGrid that ships with Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 3, the Clip property will return the contents of the selected cells
and you will see that data in the dialog box.
