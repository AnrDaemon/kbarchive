TITLE   :XFOR: RTF Information Lost When Sent Through GroupWise Connector
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Rich Text Format (RTF) information that is used in the message body or subject
line is converted into plain text. This applies to all messages that have to
pass through the Novell API gateway.

CAUSE
=====

The API gateway does not recognize RTF information, and subsequently converts
all characters to plain text format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise is dependent on the API
gateway for interoperability between Exchange Server and GroupWise. Any
limitation of the API gateway will directly affect the fidelity of messages
traversing the GroupWise connector. Note that this applies to all versions of
the GroupWise connector.
