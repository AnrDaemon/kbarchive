TITLE   :FIX: Scale and Line Methods Work Differently on Printer Object
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbservicepack kbPrinting kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Scale and Line methods are used to display a line on a form in a Visual
Basic project. When the same arguments for the Scale and Line methods are used
with the Printer object, the lines on the printed page are different from those
displayed on the form. The expected behavior is that the line printed on the
page will match the line displayed on the form.

CAUSE
=====

The Printer.Scale method does not properly handle the case where the value of
one of the XY coordinates in the second point is less than the value of
corresponding coordinate in the first point.

For example, the following statement would behave incorrectly because the value
of the second Y coordinate is less than that of the first one.

   Printer.Scale (0, 5)-(10, 0)

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the call to the Scale method and replace it by setting the ScaleLeft,
ScaleTop, ScaleWidth, and ScaleHeight properties as shown in the sample in the
MORE INFORMATION section.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section illustrates how to create a Visual Basic project that demonstrates
this behavior. It assumes you are familiar with using the methods of the Printer
and Form objects.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. Add three CommandButton controls to Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the General Declaration section of Form1:

      Option Explicit

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Scale (0, 5)-(10, 0)
         Line (0, 4)-(10, 3)
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command2_Click()
         Printer.Scale (0, 5)-(10, 0)
         Printer.Line (0, 4)-(10, 3)
         Printer.EndDoc
      End Sub

      Private Sub Command3_Click()
         Printer.ScaleLeft = 0
         Printer.ScaleTop = 5
         Printer.ScaleWidth = 10
         Printer.ScaleHeight = -5
         Printer.Line (0, 4)-(10, 3)
         Printer.EndDoc
      End Sub

4. Run the project. Click Command1 to draw a line on Form1 then click Command2
   to print a line.

   RESULT: The endpoint of the line on the right side of the printed page is
   higher than the starting point. On Form1 the endpoint is lower. The expected
   behavior is that the line on the printed page should match the line that
   appears on Form1.

5. Click Command3 and compare the printed output to the screen image. The output
   now matches correctly.
