TITLE   :FIX: Private Enum Statements Cause an Application Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbCtrlCreate kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user-created ActiveX control contains several private Enum statements. When
this user control is added to a Visual Basic project and the project containing
the usercontrol is run, an application error occurs that terminates Visual
Basic.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this behavior by declaring your Enum statements as Public
rather than Private.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 3. For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section demonstrates how to create a project that reproduces the bug
behavior. The section assumes you are familiar with creating an ActiveX control
and adding it to a Standard EXE project.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. On the File menu, click Add Project to add a new ActiveX Control project to
   the project group. UserControl1 is created by default.

3. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of
   UserControl1:

   Option Explicit
   Private Enum Test1
      Var1
   End Enum

   Private Enum Test2
      Var2
   End Enum

   Private Enum Test3
      Var3
   End Enum

   Private Enum Test4
      Var4
   End Enum

4. Close all the Windows associated with the UserControl. Add a UserControl1
   control to Form1.

5. On the Run menu, select Start, or press the F5 key to start the program. The
   following error message is displayed:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.
