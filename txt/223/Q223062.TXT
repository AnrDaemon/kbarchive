SYMPTOMS
========

Rows will not be added to an ADO Data Control's Recordset if the field values
are set programmatically in the OnAddNew event of the DataGrid.

CAUSE

This behavior was due to a bug in the DataGrid Control (msdatgrd.ocx).

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This code uses the Biblio database that comes with Visual Basic.

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0 and create a new EXE project. Form1 is added by
   default.

2. Add the following two controls to the default form:

Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0 (OLEDB)
Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)

3. Set the properties of the ADO Data Control, ADODC1, as follows:

ConnectionString  Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.3.51;DataSource=
                  C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\Biblio.mdb
RecordSource
                  "SELECT * FROM Authors"

4. Set the properties of the DataGrid, DataGrid1, as follows:

DataSource        ADODC1
AllowAddNew       True
TabAction         2-dbgGridNavigation

5. Add following code to the default form:

      Private Sub DataGrid1_OnAddNew()
         DataGrid1.Columns("Author").Text = "Test"
         DataGrid1.Columns("Year Born").Text = 1996
      End Sub

6. Run the project. Go to the last record in the DataGrid (the blank row) and
   click on any cell. The second and third columns will have the default values
   "Test" and "1999" entered. Continue tabbing through the cells so that the new
   record gets updated.

7. End the program , and then run again. Note that the new row has not actually
   been added.
