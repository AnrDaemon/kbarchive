SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to bring the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator online
on one of the nodes in Microsoft Cluster Server, the following error messages
may occur:

   Source: Service Control Manager
   Event ID: 7024
   Description: The MSDTC service terminated with service-specific error
   3221229574.

   Source: MSDTC
   Event ID: 53313
   Description: XATM log object failed to set log encryption key:
   File=d:\viper\src\dtc\xatm\src\xatmlog.cpp Line=793.

   Source: MSDTC
   Event ID: 4195
   Description: Could not initialize the MS DTC XA transaction manager.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is not properly
installed or is malfunctioning on one or both nodes on the Cluster Server
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, proceed through the following checklist of items on the
Cluster Node that the MSDTC fails to start on. If none of the items in the
checklist help resolve the issue, then you will have to remove and reinstall the
MSDTC on the Cluster Server computer.

Before performing the following steps, take the MSDTC service offline if it is
not already. It is also advisable to set the Advanced Properties of the MSDTC
Cluster Resource to "Do Not Restart," and then move the Resource Group with the
MSDTC Resource in it to the Node on which the MSDTC Resource fails to start.

1. From a command line, type the following:

   DAC

   This should launch the MSDTC Admin Console. From the Admin Console, click the
   Advanced Tab. Verify that the Drive and Location for the MSDTC log is
   correct.

   If the MSDTC Admin Console does not run, then proceed directly to Removing the
   MSDTC.

2. Make sure the Msdtc.log file exists in the MSDTC Log directory location
   determined from Item 1. If this directory does not exist, then create it
   manually.

3. Check permissions to the MSDTC LOG directory and files (Everyone Full
   Control).

4. Delete the Dtcxatm.log file..

5. If the MSDTC Admin Console is still open, close it. From a command line, type
   the following:

   DAC

   This should launch the MSDTC Admin Console. From the Admin Console, click the
   Advanced Tab, and then click the "Reset Log" button. If a log file already
   exists, and you are asked if you want to delete it, choose "YES."

   If the MSDTC Admin Console will not run, then proceed directly to removing the
   MSDTC.

If the above steps did not resolve the problem and the MSDTC will still not come
online, then you must remove and reinstall the MSDTC on the Cluster Server
computer. Use the following steps to remove the MSDTC from both nodes on the
Cluster Server computer, and then reinstall the MSDTC.

To remove the MSDTC, do the following:

1. Move the Cluster Resource Group to Node A where you want to install the MSDTC
   Resource onto. If SQL Server is installed and clustered on the system, it is
   recommended that you install the MSDTC into the SQL Server Cluster Group.

   DO NOT INSTALL THE MSDTC INTO THE DEFAULT CLUSTER GROUP!

2. On Node A, go to a command prompt and type the following:

   msdtc -remove

3. On Node B, go to a command prompt and type the following:

   msdtc -remove

4. Remove the MSDTC instance from the Cluster Resource Group.

To reinstall the MSDTC, do the following:

1. From a command prompt on node A type the following:

   msdtc -install -d %windir%\system32 -l <location of MSDTC log file on
   shared disk> -v <Name of virtual server in the resource group you wish
   to install the MSDTC instance into.>

   NOTE: If the incorrect path is used on the "-d" switch, an Event 7000 with
   source of Service Control Manager will be logged in the System Event Log. It
   will have the following Description:

   The MSDTC service failed to start due to the following error: The filename,
   directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.


2. If the version of either the Msdtc.exe or the Msdtc.dll file on Node B is
   newer than 1997.11.532.0, then from a command prompt on Node B type the
   following:

   msdtc -join %windir%\system32

   -or-

   msdtc -join

Note: If you are installing or reinstalling the MSDTC Resource into a SQL Server
Cluster Group, you must add the SQL Server resource into the MSDTC dependency
list. If this is not performed, then the SQL Server group may take up to five
minutes to failover.
