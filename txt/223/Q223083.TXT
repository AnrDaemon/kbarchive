-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS

After using the Remove method of the MSHFlexGrid, rows added with the AddItem
method may not be visible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new standard Visual Basic project. Form1 is create by default.

2. Add the MSHFlexGrid to the Visual Basic toolbox.

3. Place an MSHFlexGrid and two CommandButtons on the form.

4. Add the following code to your application:

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       MSHFlexGrid1.AddItem "Hello"
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command2_Click()
       MSHFlexGrid1.RemoveItem MSHFlexGrid1.Rows - 1
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Command1.Caption = "AddItem"
       Command2.Caption = "RemoveItem"
   End Sub

5. Run the project

6. Click the "Command1" button three times to add three rows.

7. Click the "Command2" button three times to remove the three rows.

8. Click the "Command1" button three times again to add back the three rows.

If you're using the MSHFlexGrid prior to the version that shipped with Visual
Basic 6.0 Service Pack 3, you won't see the second batch of rows created by
clicking the AddItem button.

With the version of MSHFlexGrid that shipped with Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack
3, this problem does not occur.
