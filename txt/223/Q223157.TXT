SUMMARY
=======

Windows Load Balancing Service (WLBS) provides scalability and high availability
to enterprise-wide TCP/IP services, such as Web, Proxy, Virtual Private
Networking, and streaming media services. WLBS allows incoming IP traffic to be
dynamically distributed across cluster nodes (up to 32 nodes). WLBS can
automatically detect whether a node in the cluster fails. When this occurs, the
remaining nodes can adjust to take over the workload.

Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS) is software that supports the connection of two
servers into a cluster for higher availability and easier manageability of data
and programs such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, and so on.
MSCS can automatically detect and recover from server failures or program
problems.

WLBS is fully complementary to MSCS. MSCS provides a reliable platform for
database, messaging, and related program services by using "failover" for two
nodes, while WLBS balances and distributes client connections (TCP/IP
connections) over multiple servers. In a two-tier configuration, MSCS handles
the back-end data service layer, while WLBS handles the front-end client user
interface (UI) layer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Currently, Microsoft does not recommend or support running MSCS and WLBS on the
same node. The effect of the failover of MSCS on WLBS' handling of the virtual
IP address on the cluster network adapter has not been tested.

MSCS' IP addresses should not be the same as WLBS' virtual IP address. MSCS could
use WLBS' dedicated IP address or another IP address on a different network
adapter.
