======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Visual Basic on a system using Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 or 4
with the video mode set to the True Color display, a compressed 32x32 version of
the icon appears in the Title bar of the form despite the fact that the icon
file contains a 16x16 version of the icon. Assuming that the icon file contains
both a 32x32 and 16x16 version of the icon, Visual Basic should display the
16x16 version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section illustrates how to create a sample project that demonstrates the
bug behavior. It assumes that you are running Visual Basic on a system using
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or 4. The display setting of this system must
be set to True Color. The section also assumes you have an icon file with a
32x32 version and a 16x16 version of the icon.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Set the Icon property of Form1 to the icon file.

   A compressed version of the 32x32 icon appears in the Title bar of Form1. The
   expected behavior is the 16x16 version of the icon appears in the Title bar.
