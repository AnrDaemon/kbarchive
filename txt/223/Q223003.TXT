TITLE   :XFOR: OLE Objects Sent From GroupWise To Exchange Are Lost
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

OLE objects sent from Novell GroupWise to Exchange Server using the Microsoft
Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise will be lost when the message is
received by the user in Exchange Server. Note that this applies to all versions
of the GroupWise connector.

CAUSE
=====

The API gateway does not recognize OLE objects in the message body and is
discarding these objects.

STATUS
======

Microsoft confirms this to be a limitation of the GroupWise connector which is
dependent on the API gateway for interoperability between Exchange Server and
Novell GroupWise.
