The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to deploy an Internet
Information Server (IIS) application to a Web server, you receive the following
error message:

   Unexpected error number C0042116 has occurred: The Web server returned the
   following error: Files specified in section RInstallApplicationFiles of INF
   file jallen8.INF are busy. Can not install them unless allowed to do a
   REBOOT.

CAUSE
=====

You have included WebClass Runtime, Visual Basic Runtime, or OLE Automation
files in your package. The PDW is not able to update these system files while
they are in use on the Web server.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not need to update the WebClass Runtime, Visual Basic Runtime, or OLE
Automation files, then create the IIS package without these system files. If you
do need to update these system files, then create a Standard Setup Package,
which will allow the installation program to reboot.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
