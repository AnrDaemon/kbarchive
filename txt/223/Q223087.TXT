-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An ActiveX Control does not respond to Accelerator Keys, such as END, when
hosted in Internet Explorer.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known bug.

RESOLUTION
==========

This has been fixed in the Visual Studio Service Pack 3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

   Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

The special navigation and selection accelerator keys do not work in the
standard Visual Basic controls in an ActiveX control in the browser.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start an ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Place a textbox on the control.

3. Save the project.

4. From the Visual Basic Add-Ins menu, select the Add-In Manager.

5. Make sure the Packaging and Deployment Wizard (PDW) is loaded and close that
   dialog box.

6. Select the PDW from the Add-Ins menu.

7. Allow PDW to save and compile the control, then select Internet packaging.

8. Accept the rest of the default options for the PDW.

9. Open the .htm file created in the previous step with Internet Explorer.

10. Click in the textbox on the control to give it focus and press HOME or END.

If you built the control without Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 3 installed,
nothing will happen.
