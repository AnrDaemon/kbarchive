STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Data Project in Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Make sure that the Visual Basic toolbox is NOT visible within the IDE when
   Visual Basic loads. If it is, close the toolbox, exit Visual Basic, start it
   up again, and repeat step 2.

3. From the Project window, double-click the "frmDataEnv" form to view its
   design.

4. Click on the form.

   This causes an Access Violation in VB6.exe.

NOTE:

 - There is no problem with clicking on the form if the toolbox is shown in the
   IDE.

 - This occurs only in the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE and not at run-time.
