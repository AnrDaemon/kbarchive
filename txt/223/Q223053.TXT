KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 in an installation
folder that has spaces in its name (for example, C:\Program Files), SMS is not
installed correctly. However, the SMS Setup Wizard indicates that the
installation is complete. If you try to start the SMS Administrator console, the
following error message is displayed:

   Cannot find Mfc42u.dll in the existing path.

The only SMS service that runs is the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER service.

If you reboot the site server, the server does not complete the reboot cycle, and
stops with the following error message displayed:

   STOP: C000021a {Fatal System Error} The Windows Logon Process Failed to start
   normally.

WORKAROUND
==========

Install SMS in the default folder, or select a folder that does not contain
spaces in its name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
