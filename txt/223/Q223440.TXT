SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to upgrade Microsoft Small Business Server (SBS) version 4.0 or
4.0a to SBS version 4.5, you may receive the following warning message:

   WARNING: The version of Small Business Server you are installing only
   supports 40-bit encryption. If you continue, the encryption strength
   available to you will be reduced from 128-bit to 40-bit, and it may not be
   possible to recover full 128-bit capability. If you do not want your current
   level of encryption to be changed, you should cancel Setup at this time and
   run Setup again using a 128-bit version of Small Business Server. Do you wish
   to continue?

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you try to upgrade the 128-bit version of SBS to a
40-bit version of SBS. The warning is to inform you that your 128-bit encryption
will change to 40-bit encryption if you choose to continue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue if you want to return to 128-bit encryption, install
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.
