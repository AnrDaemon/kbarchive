TITLE   :XFOR: Connector for cc:Mail Loops Trying to Import Same Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Connector for Lotus cc:Mail loops trying to import the same
message. If, for whatever reason, the connector receives a message that the
cc:Mail IMPORT program returns result code 1 (contained in the description for
event 59 in the application event log), it is likely that the cc:Mail IMPORT
program will not delete the original .ccm file that it was asked to import. The
result is that the connector continually tries to import the same message. A
non-delivery report is written to the .und file for each attempt that is made to
import the message; consequently, the .und file gets larger and larger.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Connector for cc:Mail has been modified to work around this class
of error from the cc:Mail import program, and remove the .ccm file from the
import directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
