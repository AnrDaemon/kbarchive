MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic. Leave the default name
   Project1. UserControl1 is created by default.

2. Compile the project to generate Project1.ocx, and save the project.

3. Use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to create an Internet download
   package.

4. If not already installed, add the Windows Desktop Update component. From the
   Control Panel, click Add/Remove Programs, and select Microsoft Internet
   Explorer 4.0. Click Add/Remove and then select the appropriate option.

5. Right-click the desktop and select Properties from the shortcut menu.

6. Select the Web tab from the Display Properties dialog box.

7. Make sure "View my Active Desktop as a Web page" is selected, and click New.

8. Click No in the next dialog box, and then browse to the .htm page hosting our
   control (Project1.htm).

9. Select Project1.htm and click OK. You should see that the UserControl is now
   part of the desktop.

10. Close the shell either by logging off or selecting Shut Down from the Start
   button.

You will see either an Access Violation in the Explorer process at a location
where the Msvbvm60.dll was loaded or a dialog box stating the Explorer is not
responding. If the user turns off the Active Desktop before shutting down the
shell, then this problem will not occur.
