PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbDatabase kbRDO kbVBp600bug kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using RDO with Visual Basic 6.0, it is possible to declare the RDOEngine
object WithEvents so that you can trap informational messages that are returned
from the underlying ODBC driver. These messages will be raised in the
RDOEngine_InfoMessage event.

When using RDO in a Visual Basic 6.0 application, you may see additional
informational messages being raised through the RDOEngine_InfoMessage event
under various circumstances. In these cases this event is being fired
incorrectly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code reproduces this problem. This code assumes that you are using
SQL Server as your database. You will need to modify the connection string to
point to your SQL Server.

1. Create a new Visual Basic 6.0 Project. Form1 is created by default. Set a
   reference to the Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0 library.

2. Add a CommandButton to the default form.

3. Place the following code in the default form:

   Dim WithEvents rEngine As rdoEngine
   Dim cn As rdoConnection
   Const CONNECTSTR = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=(local);database=pubs;uid=sa;pwd="

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
       
       Set Query = New rdoQuery
       Query.SQL = "Begin transaction" & vbCrLf & "Rollback transaction"
       Set Query.ActiveConnection = cn
       Query.Prepared = False
       Query.RowsetSize = 1
       Query.Execute               '*** This line causes the informational message ***

   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       
       Set rEngine = RDO.rdoEngine
       Dim Query As rdoQuery
       Set cn = New rdoConnection
       cn.Connect = CONNECTSTR
       cn.EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt
       
   End Sub

   Private Sub rEngine_InfoMessage()
       
       Dim myerr As rdoError
       For Each myerr In rdoErrors
               Debug.Print myerr.Number & " -- " & myerr.Description
               
       Next

   End Sub
