SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), a Windows NT 4.0 RAS client
may not be able to connect to a Windows NT 4.0 SP4 RAS server when the RAS
client chooses Windows NT 3.1 as the dial-up server type. This problem occurs on
all Far East versions of Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4, but not on other
languages.
