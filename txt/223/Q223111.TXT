Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX Control project in Visual Basic. UserControl1 is created
   by default.

2. Save and compile UserControl1 as Project1.OCX.

3. On the Project menu, click Project1 Properties. Click the Component tab and
   confirm that Version Compatibility is set to Project Compatibility.

4. On the File menu, click Add Project. Select ActiveX DLL in the Add Project
   dialog and click OK. (This will create a project group).

5. On the Project menu, click Components. Check the Project1 VBP you just
   created and click OK.

6. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class1:

   Option Explicit

   ' local object reference to the ActiveX Usercontrol
   Private WithEvents ctlUserControl As Project1.UserControl1

   Public Sub InitControl(ctlControl As Object)

       ' create a local reference to the Usercontrol that
       ' is passed in through this method. This is where
       ' the run-time error will be generated.
       Set ctlUserControl = ctlControl
       
       ' display a dialog that the reference was set properly
       MsgBox "ActiveX Usercontrol Reference Was Set", vbOKOnly, "ActiveX DLL Message"
       
   End Sub

7. Save and compile the Project Group.

8. Create a new Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

9. On the Project menu, click Components. Check the Project1 ocx you just
   created and click OK.

10. Site a copy of UserControl1 onto the default form (Form1).

11. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   ' local object reference to the ActiveX DLL object
   Private cTestServer As Object

   Private Sub Form_Load()

       ' create an instance of the ActiveX DLL Object
       Set cTestServer = CreateObject("Project2.Class1")
       
       ' call a method of the object, passing in the usercontrol
       cTestServer.InitControl UserControl11
       
   End Sub

12. Press the F5 key to run the project. The project will load and run without
   error.

13. Save and compile the Standard EXE.

14. Open the Project Group that contains the ActiveX DLL and ActiveX
   Usercontrol.

15. Compile the Project Group ten (10) times.

16. Open the Standard EXE project.

17. Press the F5 key to run the project. The run-time error will be generated.
