The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the POST command in an application with an URL over 2 KB in size
(2048 characters), the POST command returns an error code instead of
successfully posting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Server Outlook Web Access (OWA) component installs a
global ISAPI filter, Exchfilt.dll, which will not pass URLs over 2 KB in length.
There is a fixed buffer size in Exchfilt.dll of 2048 characters.

If OWA is installed on your Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) computer,
the ISAPI filter limitation on Exchfilt.dll may also affect other applications
trying to pass a long URL.

For additional information on ISAP filters see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
