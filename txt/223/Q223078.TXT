TITLE   :FIX: DataGrid Column Widths Incorrect When Using MDAC 2.1
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbCtrl kbVBp600bug kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3fix kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The width of a DataGrid column bound to an ADO field of type adBSTR is very
narrow under MDAC 2.1 compared to the width of an adBSTR column under MDAC 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

A bug fix in MDAC 2.1 changed the return value for GetColumnInfo calls on
columns of type adBSTR. This fix exposed a limitation in the DataGrid
control(MSDATGRD.OCX).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To create this project, you must have MDAC 2.1 installed.

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Create a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

3. Add the following Project References:

   Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.1 Library

4. Add the following Project Components:

   Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)

5. Add the following control to Form1:

   1 - Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)

6. Paste the following code into Form1's Code Window:

   Private rs As ADODB.Recordset

   Private Sub Form_Load()

       'Create a new empty recordset with six fields
       Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
       
       With rs
          .Fields.Append "Column1", adBSTR, 25
          .Fields.Append "Column2", adInteger
          .Fields.Append "Column3", adBSTR, 25
          .Fields.Append "Column4", adVarChar, 25
          .Fields.Append "Column5", adBSTR, 25
          .Fields.Append "Column6", adDBTimeStamp, 25
          .Open
       End With
      
      'Bind the DataGrid to the new empty recordset
       Set Me.DataGrid1.DataSource = rs

   End Sub

7. Run the project. Note the narrow widths of Column1, Column3, and Column5,
   which display the adBSTR fields.
