======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the French, Italian, or Spanish versions of Visual Basic 6.0, when adding
control details to the repository, the following error message occurs:

in French:

   "Ordinals 27000->27012, 27106->27109, 27111->27113 introuvables"

in English:

   "Ordinals 27000->27012, 27106->27109, 27111->27113 not found"

If no controls have been added to the form yet, the Add-in should load without
error, but if a control is subsequently added to the form, the same error
occurs.

CAUSE
=====

In the string localization process, some strings in repvbrc.dll that should not
have been changed, were localized; specifically, STR 1, 27000->27012,
27106->27109, 27111->27113. That change produces the error.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install French Visual Basic 6.0 on a clean French machine.

2. Open the file VBaddin.ini in the Windows directory, and add the following
   line:

   Repository.vbaddin=0

3. Start Visual Basic 6.0 with a Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by
   default.

4. Add any control to the form.

5. From the Complements (Add-ins) menu, select Gestionnaire de complements
   (Add-in manager).

6. Load the Complement Microsoft Repository pour Visual Basic (Repository VB
   Add-in). The error listed above occurs.

NOTE: If there are any controls on the form, the error listed above occurs when
the Add-in is loaded. If no controls have been added to the form yet, the Add-in
should load without error, but if a control is subsequently added to the form,
the same error will then occur.
