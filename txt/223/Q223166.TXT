Books Online is attempting to use an older version of one of the following
files:

Control                                       File Name      Version Number
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Common Controls ActiveX Control DLL   comctl32.ocx   5.0.37.14
Common Dialog ActiveX Control                 comdlg32.ocx   5.0.37.14
Microsoft OLE Property Support DLL            olepro32.dll   5.0.4055.1

Older versions of these files may be installed by other software programs, such
as the software included with IOMEGA Zip drives or Jaz drives. The correct
versions of these files should be installed in your system directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

Unregister these files using REGSVR32 with the /U option and then register the
correct versions in your system directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent ActiveX control conflicts such as this from occurring, remove all
other copies of these files from directories other than the system directory.
Your system directory should contain the latest versions of ActiveX controls.
Register the versions in your system directory.
