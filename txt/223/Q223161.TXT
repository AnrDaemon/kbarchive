SUMMARY
=======

This article explains ESE Zeroing, a feature first included in Microsoft
Exchange Server, version 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ESE Zeroing is a feature designed to overwrite unused pages in the Exchange
Server databases with zeroes so that the data within these unused pages cannot
be recovered using conventional means. When an item is deleted from the Exchange
Server (with Deleted Item Retention disabled), such as when a user deletes a
message from their mailbox, the item is dereferenced and the pages that item was
occupying are marked as unused.

When ESE Zeroing is enabled, the data that is contained in unused pages is
overwritten with various characters (either 'z', 'd', 'l', or 'u', depending on
the type of page being overwritten) during an online backup. As each database
page is written to the tape, the page is overwritten with zeroes in the database
on the hard disk one time. After the backup has completed, the deleted data is
on the tape, but is no longer in the database and cannot be recovered using
conventional means.


To enable ESE zeroing during online backups with Microsoft Exchange Server
Service Pack 2, you must add the following registry entry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following registry subkey:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

3. Add the following entry:

   Name: "Zero Database During Backup" (without quotes)
   Type: REG_DWORD
   Value: 0x00000001.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After this change has been applied, the Microsoft Exchange Information Store
service must be stopped and restarted for these changes to take effect.

You will now receive ESE Zeroing notifications in the Windows NT Event Viewer's
Application log after an online backup. Additionally, you will receive an Event
ID 197 and 198 for each Information Store database on the server.

Event ID 197 from ESE97 is logged when the database zeroing operation starts.

Event ID 198 from ESE97 is logged when database zeroing is completed. This event
will give details about the operation. The output will resemble the following:

   MSExchangeIS ((###) ) Online zeroing of database
   D:\EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB finished after # seconds with err #
   #### pages
   # blank pages
   #### pages unchanged since last zero
   ### unused pages zeroed
   ##### used pages seen
   ## deleted records zeroed
   # unreferenced data chunks zeroed

where the #'s are numbers that will vary from system to system.

An additional switch has been added to ESEUTIL as of Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5 Service Pack 2. ESEUTIL /z will perform the zeroing of unused
database pages in the same manner as explained above, by running an offline
command-line database utility. It will also detect and zero orphaned long
values. For more information about orphaned long values, see the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

   Q185271 XADM: Orphaned LV Errors Running ESEUTIL Consistency Checker."

   SECURE:
   DESCRIPTION: Removes all deleted records from database.
   SYNTAX: ESEUTIL /z (database name)
   PARAMETERS: (database name) - filename of database to compact, or one of
   /ispriv, /ispub, or /ds (see NOTES below)
   NOTES: 1. The switches /ispriv, /ispub, and /ds use the Registry to
   automatically set the database name for the appropriate Exchange store.

Running ESEUTIL /z against the Exchange Server databases will yield an output
similar to the following:
