TITLE   :XCLN: Voting Buttons Disappear when Sending Message to CR
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message with Voting Buttons is sent to a custom recipient (CR), the
Voting Buttons are gone when the recipient receives the message.

CAUSE
=====

By default, when a custom recipient is created, rich text e-mail is not enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Exchange Server Administrator program, get the properties for the custom
recipient mailbox, then go to the Advanced tab, and click to enable the "Allow
Rich Text in Messages" check box. This will allow rich text to be sent to the
custom recipient.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Voting Buttons require the message be sent in rich text. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q180320 OL98: (CW) Voting and Meeting Buttons Missing

Additionally, if the custom recipient is connecting to a third-party e-mail
server that strips out rich text formatting, he or she will not be able to use
Voting Buttons. The same is true for users who are getting e-mail through a
client that has rich text disabled, or does not support rich text messages. Some
POP3 clients support HTML messages, but not rich text.
