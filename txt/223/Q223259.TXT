SUMMARY
=======

When you install the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Server from the Windows NT
Option Pack (NTOP) in order to add fail-over enabled FTP Sites on a Microsoft
Cluster Server Resource Group, you must also install the World Wide Web Server
from the NTOP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The files used by the Microsoft Cluster Administrator tool to create IIS Server
Instances are only installed during the World Wide Web Server installation piece
of the NTOP. If you choose to only install the FTP Server on the Microsoft
Cluster Server, then the IIS clustering files will not get installed on the
Cluster Server.

If you want to create IIS Server instances of the FTP Sites on the Microsoft
Cluster Server, but you have only installed the FTP Server on the Microsoft
Cluster Server, you can run the NTOP Setup again and choose Add/Remove programs.
Choose to install the World Wide Web Server.

For the proper installation instructions for NTOP on Microsoft Cluster Server
1.0, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191138 How to Install Windows NT Option Pack on Cluster Server

After the World Wide Web Server is installed on the Cluster Server computer, you
can create IIS Server instances for your FTP Sites.

If you want to disable your World Wide Web Server, go to Control Panel Services
and set the startup type of the World Wide Web Publishing Service to Disabled.
