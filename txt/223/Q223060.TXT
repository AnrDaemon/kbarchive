The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Visual Basic T-SQL Debugger to debug SQL Server 7.0 stored
procedures, you might see incorrect values for input parameters in the Local
Variables window.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 on the client
(Visual Basic) computer. You do not need to install the updated T-SQL Debugger
components on the server (SQL Server) computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Visual Basic Standard Exe project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Open the Data View window.

3. Create a Data Link to a SQL Server 7.0 Pubs database.

4. Open the Stored Procedures folder.

5. Right-click the reptq3 stored procedure and select Debug.

6. Populate the three parameters.

7. Step into the stored procedure.

   You'll see that all three parameters in the Local Variables window have the
   same value.

   This problem only occurs with SQL Server 7.0.
