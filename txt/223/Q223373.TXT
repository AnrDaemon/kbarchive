TITLE   :SNA Server Rejects Host's BIND Response
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsna400sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your VTAM version to 4.4 on the host, SNA Server starts
rejecting the host's BIND responses with an UNBIND(06):

   Invalid session parameters:
   The BIND negotiation has failed because the primary half-session cannot
   support parameters specified by the secondary.

In the Windows NT application log the following event may be seen:

   Event ID: 22
   Description: APPC session activation failure:
   BIND negotiated parameters unacceptable, Sense data = 10050000.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server checks the BIND response pacing parameters to ensure that the PRIMARY
RECEIVE WINDOW FIELD SIZE is equal to THE SECONDARY SEND WINDOW SIZE. If this is
not true, then the BIND response is rejected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, change the configuration files on the host that are
responsible for coding the BIND image so that the BIND RSP ensures the PRIMARY
RCV WINDOW SIZE = THE SECONDARY SEND WINDOW SIZE rather then making byte 13
equal zero.

Also note that IBM has produced a PTF and an APAR that addresses this problem for
OS390 V2.5 and VTAM 4.4. For information about obtaining this PTF and APAR,
please contact IBM Technical Support or visit IBM's Web site at
http://www.ibm.com.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IBM Formats Reference Manual indicates the following for byte 13 of a BIND
response:

 - Bits 0-1: Reserved
 - Bits 2-7: Primary receive window size, in binary, for session-level pacing

NOTE: A value of 0 means no pacing of requests flowing to the primary (for
one-stage pacing in the secondary-to-primary direction, this field is redundant
with, and will indicate the same value as, the secondary send window size--see
byte 8, bits 2-7).
