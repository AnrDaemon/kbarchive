======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic 6.0 project contains two forms with Form1 containing a TextBox
and a CommandButton. The LostFocus event of the TextBox displays a second form
as modal. When you run the project and click the CommandButton, the modal form
appears and the CommandButton Click event fires, but should not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
   default.

2. From the Project menu, click Add Form, and then click Open. Form2 is added to
   your project.

3. Add a TextBox and a CommandButton to Form1.

4. Copy the following code to the Code window of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Debug.Print "Command1_Click"
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Load()
       Text1.Text = ""
       Text1.TabIndex = 0
   End Sub

   Private Sub Text1_LostFocus()
       Debug.Print "Text1_LostFocus"
       If Text1.Text = "" Then
           Form2.Show vbModal
       End If
   End Sub

5. With the Immediate Window visible, run the project. On the Run menu, select
   Start, or press the F5 key to start the program. Click the CommandButton.

   BUG: The Text1 LostFocus event followed by the CommandButton Click event is
   fired.

   The expected behavior is for the Text1 LostFocus event to fire but the
   Command1 Click event should not.
