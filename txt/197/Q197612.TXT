======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a physical directory (under WWWROOT) and then create a virtual
directory in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) with the same name, the
original directory (the physical path) is inaccessible from a URL.

CAUSE
=====

You need to refresh the MMC. When you create a virtual directory in the MMC, the
physical directory is excluded. If you refresh the MMC interface, you will see
only the virtual directory. This behavior is also the same for application
roots. Note that in Internet Information Service 4.0, you may need to restart
the MMC to see the change.

RESOLUTION
==========

Refresh the MMC by clicking Action and then Refresh. You may need close the MMC
and then restart it.
