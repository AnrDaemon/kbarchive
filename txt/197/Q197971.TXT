======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Tmp.edb file is stored in the Exchange Server Mdbdata and Dsadata
directories which are considered the "working area" for the information store or
directory services.

The Mdbdata and Dsadata directories also contain Edb.chk (the checkpoint file),
which is important because it contains a pointer indicating which log file the
transaction roll-forward process should start with. These directories also
contain the Tmp.edb file, and it contains temporary information used by the
information store and directory services while running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Tmp.edb file is not backed up and is deleted when the information store or
directory service is shut down gracefully.

The Tmp.edb file is also used for transient storage during information store
maintenance and for temporary tables, like creating indexes or sorting data.

The Tmp.edb file does not need to be backed up.

Additional query words: temp
