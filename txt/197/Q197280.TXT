-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Incremental downloads occur that are much larger than expected. When address
additions or modifications cause new SMTP domains in the address book, this
problem may occur.

CAUSE
=====

Client Offline Address Book information contains domain name offsets that do not
match the server offsets. This causes the server to send a large number of
updates.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Directory

   File Name    Version
   -----------------------
   Oabgen.dll   5.5.2419.0

   Component: Outlook Clients

   File Name    Version
   -----------------------
   EMSABP32.DLL  5.5.2426.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix has both a server-side and client-side fix. The client-side fix allows
for a new file to be created on the client. This new OAB file, called
Pdndex.oab, holds changes to Domain Names. Clients must be updated to the
Emsabp32.dll version 5.5.2426.0 for this fix to be effective.


The Oabgen.dll file goes on the Exchange Server computer designated in the site
for OAB generation. Because the OAB-generating server can be changed to a
different server, it is a good practice to update the Oabgen.dll file on all
Exchange Server computers.
