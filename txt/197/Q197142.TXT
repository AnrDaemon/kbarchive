TITLE   :XFOR: Internet Mail Service Stops when Routing Messages
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Mail Service is configured to forward messages to another
Microsoft Exchange Server computer, and an input/output (I/O) error occurs while
the Internet Mail Service is attempting to forward a message using the EHLO
command, the Internet Mail Service may stop unexpectedly. For example, if the
Internet Mail Service sends an EHLO command to the second server, and then the
second server ends the connection before sending a response, the Internet Mail
Service may stop unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

When an I/O error occurs under these conditions, the Internet Mail Service may
not recognize that routing is being performed. As a result, it may use an
incorrect address that is NULL.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Internet Mail Service

   File Name      Version
   -------------------------
   Msexcimc.exe   5.5.2429.0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, if an input/output error occurs while the Internet Mail
Service is attempting to forward a message using the EHLO command, the Internet
Mail Service does not stop unexpectedly, and attempts to resend the message
using the HELO command.
