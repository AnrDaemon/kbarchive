TITLE   :User May Have Two Passwords After Migration from LAN Manager
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user may have two different passwords (a LAN Manager password and a Windows NT
password) without knowing it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT password may be empty if the account database was migrated from
an old LAN Manager domain (for example, by using Portuas.exe). In this case, the
old LAN Manager password (encrypted with DES) is taken from the old account
database, and the new Windows NT password (encrypted using MD4) will be empty,
because there is no way to recalculate the password from the LM database.

In Service Pack 4, security validation has changed. It is possible a user is
validated only by the Windows NT 4.0 password, which can be empty if it has not
been changed since the migration from LAN Manager.


For additional information on this security validation change, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q147706 How to Disable LM Authentication on Windows NT

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, after migration, have the user change the password in the
Windows NT domain. This can be achieved by setting the appropriate flags in the
Windows NT User Manager for Domains. After the password has changed, both
passwords (LAN Manager and Windows NT) will be kept in sync.
