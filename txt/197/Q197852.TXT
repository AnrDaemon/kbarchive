SUMMARY
=======

Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN) comes with three utilities that are
useful for troubleshooting: DSMPACK, DSMCHK and DSMDUMP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: DSMPACK is installed by default; DSMCHK and DSMDUMP must be manually
EXPANDed from the installation medium.

DSMPACK is a utility similar to Jetpack (for WINS) and is used to repair and
compress the DSMN database. This utility can be used if a system crashes or
power outage causes unexpected errors, or the DSMN Service fails to start. To
use DSMPACK, following these steps:

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Change to the DSMN database path (%SystemRoot%\System32\Syncagnt).

3. Stop the DMSN service (for example, by typing "net stop mssync").

4. Type "dsmpack /r" to defragment and repair the database.

5. Restart the DSMN service.

Sample output:

   Operation completed successfully in 6.28 seconds.

DSMCHK can be used to check the synchronization state of a user (for example, in
the logon script). The syntax for DSMCHK is:

   Usage: dsmchk -d DomainName -u UserName

                [-n NetWareServerName] [-r Number1:Number2]
          where Number1 : The number of retries
                Number2 : The interval in seconds between the retries

NOTE: Use %USERDOMAIN% and %USERNAME% in a logon script.

For additional information on DSMCHK, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q154760 How to Use the DSMN Utility to Verify Synchronized Passwords

DSMDUMP dumps the database used by DSMN to the screen. This is useful in
verifying that all your accounts and groups are replicated correctly. To use
DSMDUMP, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Change to the DSMN database path (%SystemRoot%\System32\Syncagnt).

3. Stop the DMSN service (for example, type "net stop mssync").

4. Type "dsmdump" (without the quotation marks).

5. Restart the DSMN service.

If might be useful to redirect DSMDUMP'S output to a file, for example, type
"dsmdump >db.txt".

Sample output:

   ---------------------   SERVER TABLE   ---------------------

   ------------------------------------------------------------

   --------------------   ACCOUNT TABLE   ---------------------

   1) DOMAIN ADMINS
      Rid = 512   Type = Global Group  State = Normal
      Local groups containing this global group = 544
      Propagated to servers = NULL
      LOCAL:      Version = 1

   2) DOMAIN USERS
      Rid = 513   Type = Global Group  State = Normal
      Local groups containing this global group = NULL
      Propagated to servers = NULL
