SUMMARY
=======

Print jobs from computer systems running the UNIX operating system and its
derivatives are commonly text based. These may print with a single unexpected
character in the first column. This character is a FORTRAN control code. In a
network trace, it will come across as an "r" option, but at the client console
interface level, it is also commonly called the -f or -cc option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

RFC 1179 for LPR printing dated August 1990 has a section defining suggested
behavior for line printer daemon (LPD) servers if they support FORTRAN codes.
See the quoted text below.

7.26 r - File to print with FORTRAN carriage control codes

      +---+------+----+
      | r | file | LF |
      +---+------+----+
      Command code - 'r'
      Operand - File to print

   This command causes the data file to be printed, interpreting the first
   column of each line as FORTRAN carriage control. The FORTRAN standard
   limits this to blank, "1", "0", and "+" carriage controls. Most FORTRAN
   programmers also expect "-" (triple space) to work as well.

Microsoft has not implemented this functionality in its implementation of the LPD
server.
