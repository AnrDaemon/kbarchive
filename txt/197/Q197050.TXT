TITLE   :FIX: "Version Not Found" Error With Command Line GET
PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbservicepack _IK kbSSafe600bug kbSSExplorer kbVS600sp2 kbVS600SP1 kbVS600sp3f

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual SourceSafe (VSS), when doing a GET at the command line using the -r
(recursive) and -vl (label) switches, you receive the following error and not
all files are retrieved:

   "version not found"

RESOLUTION
==========

If all clients accessing the database are Visual SourceSafe version 6.0 or
later, run DDUPD against the data directory to convert the database to the new
format. If some clients are earlier versions of VSS, use the following
workaround.

To work around this problem, select Options from the Tools menu. In the General
tab, select the "Act on Projects Recursively" option (note that after changing
this setting you must exit the VSS explorer for it to work on the command line).
On the command line, use wildcards instead of the -r switch.

For example, if the command that is failing is:

   ss get $/myproj -r -vlbeta1

then use:

   ss get $/myproj/*.* -vlbeta1


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

that has not been upgraded to the Visual SourceSafe 6.0 format.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior

   SS GET -R -VLLABEL  $/Project1
