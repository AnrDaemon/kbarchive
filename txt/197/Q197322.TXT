KEYWORDS:kberrmsg kbEEdition kbVC600 kbVC500SP3

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0sp3, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Internet Explorer and other image programs, you can successfully
view .jpg files that are created using a Sony Digital Camera. However, when you
use the viewing functionality from within the Wang/Kodak Imaging Controls
(ImgEdit.ocx) that ship with Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98, you
see one of the following error messages:

   Invalid File Format; Unable to display image when using ImgEdit OCX
   provided within the Wang Imaging Controls suite with Windows 95 or
   Windows NT 4.0

   - or -

   Path/File Access Error; Unable to read or write the specified file;
   Unable to display image within the Kodak Imaging Controls suite with
   Windows 98.

CAUSE
=====

According to the Eastman Software Web page (please see REFERENCES section):

   The Sony Mavica camera generates .JPG files without the required "JFIF"
   string in the header. The JPEG standard states that an APP0 marker and
   "JFIF" string (together with the leading SOI marker), make up the header
   that identifies them as "standard" JPEG/JFIF files. Some applications
   just recognize the leading "FFD8" SOI marker and don't look for the
   "JFIF" stamp, thus allowing them to open a wider variety of JPEG files.

The Wang/Kodak Imaging Controls follow the JPEG specification, so if the JFIF
string is missing, the current versions of Imaging raise an invalid file format
error. Both Imaging Professional and Imaging for Windows by Eastman Software
generate this error. However, Imaging Professional 2.0 by Eastman Software
performs the FFD8 check, so it can read the Sony Mavica files.

NOTE: Eastman Software now provides the Wang/Kodak Imaging Controls.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, the only workaround is to purchase Imaging Professional 2.0 by
Eastman Software.
