TITLE   :XFOR: NotesCal Returns Warning Event 2001
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange

KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Calendar Connector for Lotus Notes may generate the following warning:

   Event ID 2001
   Source:MSExchangeNotesCal
   Type:Warning
   Category:Request to Partner
   Description: The Calendar Connector could not query the calendar for
   Notes user "John Smith/Notes@Notes" due to Notes error 6402 - "Could not
   open the ID file"

CAUSE
=====

This warning is due to an incorrect configuration on the Notes Calendar
Connection property page. The property page does not check to make sure that the
Notes.ini file is specified correctly, or if the file is accessible, and thus an
incorrect configuration is possible.

RESOLUTION
==========

Confirm that the "Path to the local Notes.ini file" includes the full directory
path and file name, for example, D:\Winnt\Notes.ini. If it is not in this
format, correct the path to point to the local Notes.ini file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft acknowledges this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.
