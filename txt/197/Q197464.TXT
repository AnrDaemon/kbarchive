SYMPTOMS
========

As a result of a problem with Internet Information Server (IIS) and NTFS
Alternate Data Streams, administrators may want to determine if their server was
"attacked" by Internet users attempting to gain access to source text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS is configured by default to log access to the server. When logging is
enabled and a request is made from a browser to IIS using Alternate Data Streams
(for example http://myserver/file.asp::$DATA), IIS writes this information to
the log file. By analyzing the log files kept by the server, any attempted
access to source code can be determined.

The following examples show what a request to the "/default.asp" page of a server
would look like if an attempt was made to view the file's source code:
