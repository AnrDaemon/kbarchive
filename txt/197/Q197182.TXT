TITLE   :XFOR: PCMTA Tries to Dial Async Connection for Downstream POs
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Connector (PC) message transfer agent (MTA) incorrectly
attempts to establish a dial-up connection for downstream Microsoft Mail
postoffices, even though it was not configured to do so.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create two Microsoft Mail (PC) MTA instances: an
Asynchronous and LAN type for connecting PO1, and a LAN type for connecting PO2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Given the following setup:

The Exchange Server computer has two Microsoft Mail (PC) postoffices connectedly
directly to it, one via the LAN, the second one via an asynchronous connection.
The first Microsoft Mail (PC) postoffice also has a direct connection to a third
Microsoft Mail (PC) postoffice via a direct asynchronous connection.

1. Create a Microsoft Mail connection from the Exchange Server computer to PO1
   and PO2.

2. On the MSMI properties page of the Exchange Server computer, select "Upload
   Routing" for PO2 to establish PO3 as indirect by way of PO2.

3. Create a Microsoft Mail (PC) MTA instance of type "Async and LAN" to service
   the Exchange Server computer, PO1, and PO2.

4. Send an e-mail message from the Exchange Server computer, destined for PO3.

Result
------

The Microsoft Mail (PC) MTA instance will attempt to send the mail using a
dial-up connection to PO3, even though no information for reaching that
postoffice is defined in Exchange Server.

Expected
--------

The Microsoft Mail (PC) MTA instance should deliver the message to PO2 by means
of the LAN connection, and not attempt to send it directly to PO3.
