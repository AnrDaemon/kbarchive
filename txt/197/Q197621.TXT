The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add an IP restriction for a single computer using the Web Admin
interface in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, you may notice
that the IP address does not always appear in the list after clicking the Add
button. This is not a problem when you use the Internet Information Server
snap-in in the MMC.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you add a single computer to deny access to the Web server, add the IP
address, and then either click or tab to the next box (the subnet mask area). Be
sure that you do not add anything into the subnet mask area. Click the Add
button and the IP will be added to the list.
