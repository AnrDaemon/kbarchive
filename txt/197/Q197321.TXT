PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER::5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbVBp kbVBp500 kbVBp600 kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 and other image programs allow you to
successfully view .jpg files that were created using a Sony Digital Camera
However, you may receive the following errors if you attempt to use the file in
Visual Basic:

   Run-time Error 321, Invalid File Format; Unable to display image when using
   ImgEdit OCX provided within the Wang Imaging Controls suite with Windows 95
   or Windows NT 4.0.

-or-

   Run-time Error 75, Path/File Access Error; Unable to read or write the
   specified file; Unable to display image within the Kodak Imaging Controls
   suite with Windows 98 or Windows Me.

CAUSE
=====

The following paragraph is from the Eastman Software Web page:

   The Sony Mavica Digital Camera generates .jpg files without the required
   "JFIF" string in the header. The JPEG standard states that an APP0 marker and
   "JFIF" string, together with the leading SOI marker, make up the header that
   identifies them as "standard" JPEG/JFIF files. Some applications just
   recognize the leading "FFD8" SOI marker and do not look for the "JFIF" stamp,
   thus allowing them to open a wider variety of JPEG files. The Wang Imaging
   Controls follow the specification, so if the JFIF string is missing, the
   current versions of Imaging raise an invalid file format error. This error is
   generated in both Imaging Professional as well as Imaging for Windows.
   Imaging Professional 2.0 does the more lax "FFD8" check, and so is able to
   read the Sony Mavica files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Currently, the only workaround is to purchase Imaging Professional 2.0.
