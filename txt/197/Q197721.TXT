TITLE   :XCLN: NDR When Sending A Message to A Local Recipient
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can send a message to a local Exchange Server mailbox alone, or to an SMTP
recipient alone, but if you send a message to an SMTP recipient and a local
Exchange Server mailbox, you receive an non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the
following:

   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

         Subject:   testing pst
         Sent:   9/25/98 9:51 AM

   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

         {Exchange Mailbox} on 9/25/98 9:51 AM
               The originator does not have permission to submit message
               MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SITE:SERVER

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange Client or Outlook profiles include the Internet E- Mail
service and the Microsoft Exchange Server service. The Internet E-Mail service
is listed first on the Delivery tab, and delivery is also set to go to a .pst
file instead of the Exchange Server mailbox.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one or both of the following:

 - Set delivery to the Exchange Server mailbox instead of a .pst file on the
   Delivery tab in the client.

 - In the client, put the Microsoft Exchange Server service first in the list on
   the Delivery tab instead of the Internet E-Mail service. If you do this, then
   the Exchange Server computer MUST have a functional Internet Mail Service
   installed on it, or a route to another Exchange Server computer with an
   Internet Mail Service on it since Exchange Server will handle all outgoing
   SMTP mail, or delivery of SMTP mail based on the configuration of the
   Internet Mail Service. The Internet E- Mail service in the client would then
   only be used for receiving mail from another POP3 server.
