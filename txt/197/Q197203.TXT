-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word, a password-protected document cannot be recovered if the
password for that document is lost or forgotten. Microsoft does not offer a
service to retrieve documents to which passwords have been added, nor does it
offer any information regarding such services or processes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This policy is to prevent any damages to Microsoft Word users who rely on the
security that their passwords provide. To recover a password-protected document,
you must remember the assigned password.

NOTE: Remember that passwords are case sensitive. If you used a combination of
uppercase and lowercase letters when you set up your password, you need to use
the same combination when you use the password to access your document. Also,
before you type your password, verify that CAPS LOCK is not active.
