CAUSE
=====

This problem is because of a bug in the Notes API. This occurs because the
LAPI_Init/LAPI_InitExtended call to the Notes API fails or stops responding
(hangs) when one of the Notes-related processes is (re-)starting.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Notes connector will handle this problem in the Notes API DLL by
automatically restarting upon receiving this error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, manually restart the Exchange Notes Connector.

STATUS
======

Microsoft confirms this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This will likely shut down all three of the Notes connector processes.

Additional query words: crash, notes connector, resource, timeout
