KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Snaprint.exe generates an Access Violation when attempting to read (void*)NULL
pointer (0x00000000) from the PrtFilterJobStart function in the Print Server
Data Filter DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PrtFilterJobStart function returns a unique identifier (cast to a pointer to
a void) if it wants the opportunity to filter the data for this print job. If
the user DLL returns a NULL pointer, it is indicating that it is not interested
in filtering this job. No further calls to the user DLL will be made for this
print job.

If a FilterDLL is present, it can return a value to say "I don't want to filter
this job's data." In the SNA Server SDK Documentation, this value is listed as
NULL = 0. In the code, however, the code consistently checks against
INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE = -1. The code is fixed so that now a returned value of
NULL is updated to INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.

RESOLUTION
==========
