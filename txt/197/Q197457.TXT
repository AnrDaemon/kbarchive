SUMMARY

ATSWeb, the web-centric Anomaly Tracking System version 2.0, is a database
application designed to track issues during team development of software. ATSWeb
allows developers, designers, and testers to view active issues, review the
history of an issue, and record the resolution of issues while developing
applications. Issues can be bugs in the code, inconsistencies between the
product and the specification, or future wish-list features.

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF ATSWEB IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides the
utility "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or

This tool is not for reporting issues to Microsoft Corporation.

MORE INFORMATION

You can do the following with ATSWeb:

 - Collect, organize, sort, and view reported issues.

 - Easily add new issues, find a specific issue, and print issues.

 - Filter the database to view only those issues that contain characteristics
   you specify, such as a specific version, priority, or platform.

 - Store future feature requests for a product.

 - Easily provide or extract information you need about a project, whether you
   are a developer, manager, tester, or other team member.

   the server.
