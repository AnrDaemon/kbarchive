TITLE   :Cannot Ping a WLBS Server from Another WLBS Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you ping a cluster host's dedicated IP address from another cluster host,
you receive no response.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is a single network interface card (NIC) limitation. If you are using
a single NIC and have not selected the Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS)
multicast support, the cluster hosts will not be able to communicate with each
other even though they can exchange network traffic with outside systems.

NOTE: On a cluster host with multiple NICs (multihomed), using the Virtual NIC to
access the dedicated IP address (IP address bound to the virtual NIC but
configured not to be load balanced) of another multihomed cluster host causes
WLBS to consider this a single-NIC configuration

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, select multicast support in the WLBS Setup dialog box to
eliminate this problem.
