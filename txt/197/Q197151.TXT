TITLE   :WD97: Can't Print More Than One Page of Embedded Objects
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbole kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word displays or prints an embedded object on a single page (even if
the embedded object could span multiple pages).

CAUSE
=====

In Word, embedded objects are limited to one page.

This behavior is by design. Microsoft Word is unable to divide the display
representation of embedded objects larger than one page.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Objects of the Word document class display or print one page of an embedded
object. When double-clicked, the entire object appears in the object window.
Objects of the Microsoft Excel worksheet class display all of the information in
the object but truncate the text when printed.

Additional query words: truncated cut off cropped crop chop chopped missing
