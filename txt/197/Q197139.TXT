SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outline Numbering in Microsoft Word, if any heading style (Heading
1 through 9) appears in the text before a Heading 1 paragraph, then the Heading
1 paragraph will be numbered "2" when you apply Outline Numbering.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design in the Word versions listed at the beginning of this
article and is different from behavior seen in earlier versions of Word. In
earlier versions, heading numbering did not increment the numbering for the
Heading 1 style based on the existence of a lower style (Heading 2, for
instance) preceding Heading 1 in the document. The result in earlier versions of
Word is that the first Heading 1 paragraph would be numbered "1."

In Word, the first Heading 1 paragraph when preceded by a lower style starts with
"2" because of the existence of another heading paragraph earlier, not because
of how many earlier heading paragraphs there are. For example, if you have five
paragraphs formatted with the following heading styles:

   Heading 2
   Heading 2
   Heading 2
   Heading 2
   Heading 1

the result after numbering is that the Heading 1 paragraph is numbered as "2,"
not "5."


WORKAROUND
==========

This behavior may cause a problem in Word when you use chapter-page numbering in
your document. Heading 1 is usually used to mark the start of a chapter, so
whenever another heading style appears before the first Heading 1 paragraph,
Word numbers the first chapter number as "2." To work around this problem, use
either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Rearrange your document so the Heading 1 paragraph is the first heading-level
paragraph in your document. If this is not possible, use Method 2 instead.

Method 2
--------

1. Position the insertion point at the beginning of the Heading 1 paragraph.

2. On the Insert menu, click Break. Select the Continuous option and then click
   OK.

3. On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

4. In the Bullets And Numbering dialog box, select the Outline Numbered tab.

5. Under "List numbering", click Restart Numbering, and then click OK.

NOTE: This workaround may be inappropriate for multiple-section documents that
depend on continuous numbering.
