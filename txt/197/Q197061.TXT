SUMMARY
=======

The map information in the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this
article is based upon WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984) in Plate Carree, or
projections in rendering.

Because of the methods these programs use to display map information, you may
notice a discrepancy in the displayed position of a point on the map and the
actual latitude and longitude of the point based on the WGS-84 map datum.

Some Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments can be configured to use
different map data for their basic map functions. To obtain the best results
with Microsoft programs that support GPS input, configure your GPS instrument to
use the WGS-84 map datum.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The latitude and longitude of a single point on the Earth's surface can differ
considerably depending on the map datum you use.

For example, in the United Kingdom, the position of a point based on a pair of
latitude and longitude co-ordinates in the WGS-84 map datum may be as far as 135
meters from a point based on the same co-ordinates in the OSGB-36 map datum.

NOTE: There are more than 240 spatial reference systems known as Coordinate
Reference System (CRS) in common useage today. The map datum used by the
products listed at the top of the articles is the most common, that is, WGS84.
