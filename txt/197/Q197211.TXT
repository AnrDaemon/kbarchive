PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbenvelope word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the Return Address Omit option is selected in the Envelopes And Labels dialog
box, and you are performing a print merge to envelopes, the return address is
still included. (To locate the Return Address Omit option, click Envelopes And
Labels on the Tools menu, and select the Envelopes tab.)

WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Remove the Return Address
-----------------------------------

To remove the return address for all subsequent envelopes, regardless of the
creation method, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the User Information tab.

3. Clear the Mailing Address box and click OK.

You can now perform the print merge without printing the return address.

To remove the return address for the current print merge only, follow the steps
for setting up a print merge envelope, but before performing the print merge,
edit the main document by selecting the return address and deleting it. Continue
with the print merge as usual.

Method 2: Change the Return Address Font Color
----------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you can set the return address font color to white without having
to delete your Mailing Address or edit the merge document. To change the return
address font color, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes And Labels.

2. Click the Envelopes tab.

3. Click Options.

4. Click Return Address Font.

5. Select White for the font color.

6. Click OK twice.
