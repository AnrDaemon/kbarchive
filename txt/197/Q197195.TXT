TITLE   :Schedule+ Four-Digit Year Entries Require All Four Digits
PRODUCT :Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 7.0, 7.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Schedule+, if you type a two-digit date in a four-digit date field, Schedule+
assumes that the date is in the twentieth century (1900s).

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ does not support a two-digit year entry when the short date style is
set to a four-digit year such as MM/dd/yyyy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Set the Short Date Style
---------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, click Regional Settings, and click the Date tab.

3. Under Short date, click to select the date style from the Short date style
   list.

4. Click OK to apply the settings.

When the short date style is set to display a 2-digit year, the Schedule+ user
interface allows only 2-digit entries. All such entries are parsed into 1980
through 2079. When you set the short date style to display a 4-digit year, the
user interface allows only 4-digit entries. With this setting, if you type a
4-digit entry there is no ambiguity. If you type a 2-digit entry with the user
interface prompting for a 4-digit entry, those 2-digit entries will display as
00xx, and when the focus changes to another field they display as 19xx.

For example, you set the short date style to MM/dd/yyyy. The Schedule+ user
interface shows a 4-digit box for years. You type only a 2-digit year, "23"
(without the quotation marks). In the user interface, you see 0023 because you
did not supply the other 2 digits. When the focus changes to another field, you
see that Schedule+ turns the 0023 to 1923. If this is not the year you intended,
you can change it by typing all 4 digits. All of this is displayed in the user
interface so that it does not mislead you into thinking the 2-digit entry meant
something else.
