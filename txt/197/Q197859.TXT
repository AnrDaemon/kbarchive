KEYWORDS:kbnetwork sbs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

A backup domain controller (BDC) or standalone server can be added to the Small
Business Server (SBS) domain. Because there can only be one computer running SBS
on the network, any other servers added must run Windows NT Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The applications from the SBS server cannot be installed on the Windows NT
Server computer.

If the SBS server goes down for any reason, the BDC will only be able to validate
users logging on to the domain. Because the SBS applications cannot be installed
on the BDC or standalone server, they will not be accessible should the primary
domain controller (PDC) ever not be available.

software, Appendix B, Page 137.
