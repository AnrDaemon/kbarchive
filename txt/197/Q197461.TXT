TITLE   :Client Certificate Mapping Uses Multiple Organization Units
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a Client Certificate with multiple subject Organization
Unit (OU) fields, Internet Information Server (IIS) may not read the certificate
as expected.

CAUSE
=====

IIS does not read more than the first field of Subject OUs for some non-
Certificate Server certificate formats.

For example, if the Subject OU line contains multiple entries delimited by
semicolons, IIS will not recognize any entries beyond the first semicolon.

In the following example, Internet Information Server would detect My Company,
but not Level 1 or Level 2:

   My Company; Level 1; Level 2

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0
and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4.
