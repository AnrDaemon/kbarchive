The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Microsoft Word to automatically insert captions for Word
documents, and you then insert documents by clicking File on the Insert menu,
captions are not automatically added.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word adds captions to embedded Word document objects only, which you
insert by clicking Object on the Insert menu. The AutoCaption feature does not
apply to Word documents you insert directly as files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly insert a document and have the caption automatically added, follow
these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Object.

2. On the Create New tab, click to select Microsoft Word Document, or on the
   Create from File tab, click Browse to select an existing Word document to
   insert as a Word document object.
