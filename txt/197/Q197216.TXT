PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield word97 kbmerge

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the result of an ASK or FILLIN field is blank, the following error message
may appear when you use a REF field to recall the ASK or FILLIN field:

   Error! reference source not found

If you refer to the blank ASK or FILLIN field with a bookmark name, the following
error message appears:

   Error! bookmark not defined

Additionally, if the result of the field is blank during a mail merge operation,
the following message appears as each record with blank results is merged:

   A field calculation error occurred in record X

There is no context-sensitive Help for this error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these errors, force the field to evaluate to a space by either
typing a space in the dialog box when prompted or by setting the field default
as follows

   {Ask Answer "Question" \d " "}

where the \d switch sets the default result for a field.

An alternative workaround is to select the field and reapply the bookmark to the
field. The \d switch isn't necessary.

The bookmark that Word applies to the ASK field is placed at the end of the field
and looks like "][" when the bookmarks are visible. For example, the formula

   {ASK bookmark "question"}

would look like:

   {ASK bookmark "question" ][}

To correct this, select the field and reapply the bookmark. When you are
finished, the bookmark looks like:

   [{ASK bookmark "question" }]

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
