TITLE   :WD97: Mail Merge Attached Envelope Does Not Create Bar Code
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

KEYWORDS:word97 kbmerge

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create mail merge form letter documents and attach envelopes, bar codes
fail to print on your envelopes, even though you selected the Delivery Point Bar
Code option.

CAUSE
=====

By default, envelopes attached to mail merge form letter documents do not
include POSTNET delivery-point bar codes. When you attach an envelope to an
existing mail merge form letter, Word has no way to determine which field
contains bar code information. The steps that allow determination of ZIP Code
fields are bypassed. Although the Delivery Point Bar Code option is available
under the Envelope options, Word cannot interpret the MERGEFIELD information
into bar code information.

WORKAROUND
==========

To create mail merge envelopes with bar codes, use the Envelopes option, or
manually insert a BARCODE field above the existing envelope address fields on
the envelope, as follows:

1. Position the insertion point before the first character of the first line of
   address fields. Press ENTER to create a blank line above the existing
   address.

2. Press CTRL+F9 to create field codes. Type the following within the field
   codes.

   NOTE: You may need to turn on the field codes to complete the entry below. To
   do this, press ALT+F9. After you complete the entry, press ALT+F9 to turn the
   field codes off, as in the following example:

   {BARCODE "{Mergefield Address1}<P>
   {Mergefield PostalCode}" \u \* mergeformat}

   where Address1 is the field containing the street address or postal box
   information, <P> represents a paragraph mark, and "PostalCode" is the
   name of the field that contains the ZIP Code information.

   Use the following example:

   {BARCODE \u {mergefield zipcode}}

   where zipcode is the mergefield that contains the postal code.

Knowledge Base.
