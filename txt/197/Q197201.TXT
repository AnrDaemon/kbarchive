SUMMARY
=======

In Word, there is no default button for automatic hyphenation. However, you can
set the option as a default for future documents by modifying the Normal.dot
template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the Normal.dot template, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Open.

2. In the Files Of Type list, click Document Templates (*.dot) and be sure the
   current directory is your Template subfolder.

   In Word 97, this is typically:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Templates.

3. Select the Normal template, and then click Open.

4. On the Tools menu, point to Language, and then click Hyphenation.

5. Click to select the Automatically Hyphenate Document check box.

6. In the Hyphenation Zone box, enter the amount of space that Word should leave
   between the end of the last word in a line and the right margin.

7. In the Limit Consecutive Hyphens To box, enter the number of consecutive
   lines that can be hyphenated. Click OK.

8. Save and close the Normal template.
