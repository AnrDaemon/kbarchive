The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

SUMMARY
=======

This article addresses the following basic questions regarding Systems
Management Server:

 - How do I make a "package" in Systems Management Server?

 - How do I make a "job" in Systems Management Server?

 - How do I activate the job?

 - What do I need to do at the client computer to run the software through
   Systems Management Server?

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Create a Package
-----------------------

1. To create a package, you must first set up your package source. This step may
   be as simple as placing files into a directory, or running the command "setup
   /a".

2. After setting up your package source, open the Package window in the Systems
   Management Server Administrator program.

3. On the File menu, click New.

4. Give the Package a name.

5. At this point you have three choices: Workstation, Sharing, and Inventory.
   Select Workstation.

6. Specify the source directory that you set up in Step 1 of this procedure (for
   example, c:\package or \\server\package) and then click New.

7. Specify the command name to install or run the package, for example, setup or
   "notepad" (without the quotation marks).

8. Select the operating system platform that the package is destined for.

9. Click OK until you return to the Packages window.

Your package is now set up for distribution.

How to Create a Job
-------------------

1. To create a job, drag your newly created package and drop it on a site, a
   computer, or a group of computers. This opens the Job Details window. At this
   stage, you specify how you want to run the job.

   There are three main options for the job:

    - Send Phase
      This option specifies whether the package will be recompressed, or whether
      Systems Management Server will use the already compressed package (if the
      package has been sent before).

    - Distribute Phase
      With this option, you can specify what servers will receive the package;
      for example, default servers or a machine group. You can also select
      whether you need to redistribute the package.

    - Run Phase
      With this option, you can specify the client pieces. That is, you can
      specify when the package should be offered to the client, whether the job
      will be mandatory, or when it should expire (no longer offered).

   You can leave all of these settings at their respective default values and
   click OK.

2. You should now see three buttons: Details (the screen you were just in),
   Schedule, and Status. Click Schedule.

3. Specify options such as when the job will be activated, what priority the job
   has, and whether you want the job to repeat.

4. After specifying any options you want, click OK until you return to the
   Packages window.

Your job is now properly configured.

How to Activate the Job
-----------------------

After you specify all the job details in the Job Details window and click OK,
Systems Management Server creates a Pending job. Systems Management Server will
activate the job at its next watchdog cycle.

What to Do at the Client Computer to Run the Software
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Before sending the package, install the client as a Systems Management Server
   client.

2. Send the package to the client.

3. After the package has been distributed, use Package Command Manager (PCM) on
   the client to run the package.
