The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Active Directory Service Interfaces, versions 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to obtain network
domain information from within Visual FoxPro. This article shows an example of
how to obtain this information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: To use the following example, you must install the Active Directory
Service from the following Web site or the Microsoft Developer Network CD:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/Technical/directory/adsilinks.asp

ADSI is a COM-based interface for accessing directory services. You can treat
each element of the network, such as users, printers, and computers, as an
object. Accessing the properties of the domain object allows the developer to
get information about the domain. The following code demonstrates how to do
this. Save the following code to a program file and run the program.

Sample Code
-----------

   *-- Code begins here.
   *-- Replace MyDomain with a valid domain name.
   oDomain = Getobject("WinNT://MyDomain")

   *-- Collect the properties of the oDomain object and display them.
   lsInfo = "Minimum Password Length:  " + ;

            STR(oDomain.MinPasswordLength) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Minimum Password Age:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.MinPasswordAge) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Maximum Password Age:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.MaxPasswordAge) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Maximum Bad Passwords:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.MaxBadPasswordsAllowed) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Password History Length:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.PasswordHistoryLength) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Auto Unlock Interval:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.AutoUnlockInterval) + CHR(13) + ;
            "Lock Out Observation Interval:  " + ;
            STR(oDomain.LockOutObservationInterval)

   WAIT WINDOW lsInfo
   *-- Code ends here
