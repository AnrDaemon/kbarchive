-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you merge revisions or changes between two documents in Microsoft Word, an
added table in the document being merged causes all revisions following the
table not to be merged with the original document. When this problem occurs, you
receive the following error message.

   The merged documents contain unmarked changes. Do you want to merge up to the
   first untracked change?

If you click OK, Word merges the changes up to the table in the original document
but does not merge anything after the table. If you click Cancel, Word cancels
the merge and leaves the two documents in their original state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
