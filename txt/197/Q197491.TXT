TITLE   :XADM: Large NNTP Header Causes Store to Consume 100% of CPU Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55 EXC55SP3Fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange information store process (Store.exe) may consume 100
percent of the server's processor time. This is viewed by using the Windows NT
Performance Monitor utility, clicking the Object:Process and the Counter:% CPU
Utilization. Also, viewing the "% CPU Utilization" of all of the threads being
used by the store process (in Performance Monitor, click Object:Thread and
Instance:STORE; add all of the instance STORE to the chart) one thread will
appear to be consuming 100 percent of the CPU time.


CAUSE
=====

An NNTP client was downloading a NNTP message from a folder in the Public Store,
this message had a subject line greater than 20 KB. The buffer being used to
hold the subject line was hardcoded at 20 KB. Therefore the code was continually
looping trying to read in the contents of the subject line that were past this
20 KB limit. This process resulted in high CPU usage by the information store
process.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
