TITLE   :LPD Job May Cause TCPSVCS to Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you sent a print job by using LPR to the TCP/IP Print Server, the TCP/IP
Print server stops responding (hangs) and causes over 90 percent CPU usage in
TCPSVCS.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the print job contains a value of 0x1B (ESC) in any of
the following conditions:

 - At offset 0xFFF (4095).

 - As the very last character in a file.

 - As the only character in a file.

TCPSVCS has a routine to detect PCL or PostScript jobs, which goes into an
infinite loop under these conditions.

RESOLUTION
==========
