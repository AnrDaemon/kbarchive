SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) and Internet Information Server
(IIS) version 4.0, Web sites are added to the server using the Microsoft
Management Console (MMC). Each new Web site is given a number in the metabase,
and this number is used by IIS when logging and FrontPage when installing
extensions. It is sometimes desirable to know which number corresponds to a
given Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following code was written using Windows Script Host (WSH) and lists all Web
sites by their short metabase path and name.

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Copy the following code into Notepad, and then save it to your computer as a
   file called W3sites.vbs:

         Dim objW3SVC, objSITE, strOUT
         Set objW3SVC = GetObject("IIS://LOCALHOST/W3SVC")

         If (Err <> 0) Then
         strOUT = "Error " & Hex(Err.Number) & "("
         strOUT = strOUT & Err.Description & ") occurred."
         Else
         For Each objSITE In objW3SVC
         If objSITE.class = "IIsWebServer" Then
         strOUT = strOUT & "LM/W3SVC/" & objSITE.Name & Chr(9)
         strOUT = strOUT & Chr(34) & objSITE.ServerComment
         strOUT = strOUT & Chr(34) & Chr(13) & Chr(10)
         End If
         Next
         End If

         WScript.Echo strOUT

2. To run the code, open a command prompt, and then type the following command:

      CSCRIPT.EXE W3SITES.VBS
