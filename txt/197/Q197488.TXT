TITLE   :Access Denied When Synchronizing or Promoting a BDC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You receive an "Access Denied" error message when you attempt to promote and/or
synchronize a backup domain controller (BDC) to primary domain controller (PDC)
after you apply Service Pack 4 to one or more domain controllers. This error
message occurs if you attempt to perform the promotion from a domain controller
running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3).

This issue also occurs if you attempt to perform the synchronization from a PDC
running SP3 to a BDC running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 upgrades Windows NT 4.0 security making
synchronization from a computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3
impossible. This upgrade also makes promoting a domain controller from a
computer running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 impossible.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade the PDC to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that a Windows NT 3.51 SP5 backup domain controller will have the same
behavior as a Windows NT 4.0 SP3 backup domain controller.
