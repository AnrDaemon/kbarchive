TITLE   :Registry Hive Fragmentation Leads to Excessive Size
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Processes that use the registry to repeatedly modify the same values in small
increments can cause excessive memory fragmentation in the corresponding
registry hive. The sum of the fragmented cells can become so large that the hive
size winds up many times larger than the sum of actual data in the hive.
Eventually, the sum of the hive will exceed the Registry Size Limit (RSL),
causing subsequent modifications to fail until the RSL is increased. As an
example consider the SAM hive used to store Windows NT accounts. The SAM size
frequently exceeds projected sizes due to the fact that it fragments the SAM
hive when adding members to large groups.

CAUSE
=====

In the SAM example, when a user is added to a large group it causes the registry
value for that group to be replaced and the old value added to a hash of free
lists by size of allocation. The freed cell is coalesced with the nearest
neighbor cell in memory, if it's a free cell, to create a slightly larger cell
to add to the free lists. Over several additions, the free lists can contain
several cells that are never used because they're too small. Over time the sum
of the free cells become so large that the sum of the hives exceeds RSL.

RESOLUTION
==========
