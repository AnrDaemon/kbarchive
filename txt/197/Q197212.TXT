SYMPTOMS
========

If you modify the envelope delivery or return address by changing the From Left
or From Top settings in the Envelope Options dialog box, the change you make is
not retained between documents.

To locate the From Left and From Top settings, click Envelopes And Labels on the
Tools menu, select the Envelopes tab, and then click Options.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make a permanent change to an envelope address position, you must modify the
Envelope Address or Envelope Return style. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the List box, select All Styles.

3. In the Style box, select Envelope Address (or Envelope Return).

4. Click Modify.

5. To make the change permanent, click the Add To Template check box.

6. Click Format and select Frame from the list that appears.

7. Under Horizontal, change the Position setting to a numeric distance from the
   margin by typing a number.

   For example, if you want your delivery address to be positioned 1 inch to the
   right of the margin, type "1.0" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Horizontal Position box.

8. Under Vertical, change the Position setting to a numeric distance from the
   top margin by typing in a number.

   For example, if you want the delivery position to be positioned 3 inches down
   from the top margin, type "3.0" (without the quotation marks) in the Vertical
   Position box.

9. Click OK twice, and then click Close to close the dialog boxes.

If you now click Envelopes And Labels on the Tools menu and click Options, the
From Top and From Left settings will be the settings that you specified.

By following these steps, you are applying a frame to the delivery or return
address. Modifying the style by applying only indents to the style does not
allow your changes to be retained between documents.

STATUS
======
