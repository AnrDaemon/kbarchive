SUMMARY
=======

When you start Cluster Administrator, the default behavior is to reconnect to
the last cluster that Cluster Administrator was previously connected to. In
certain circumstances, this may not be the desired action.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use a command line switch to run Cluster Administrator without having it
reconnect to previously connected clusters.

From the command line execute one of the following commands:

 - cluadmin /noreconnect

 - cluadmin /norecon

NOTE: In this case "/norecon" is an abbreviated version of "noreconnect".

Cluster Administrator starts and prompts the user with the Open Connection to
Cluster dialog box.

NOTE: The dialog box shows the last cluster or server name that the Cluster
Administrator was connected to as the first option.

Additional query words: mscs admin
