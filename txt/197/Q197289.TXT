SYMPTOMS
========

Spoofed messages coming into Exchange Server from the Internet Mail Service may
not be saved as configured in the Windows NT registry. The spoofed messages may
be saved on the system drive or not at all.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server Administrator program in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5 Service Pack 1 provides a dialog box (Configuration-Connections- Internet
Mail Service-Connections-Message Filter) for adding originator domains and user
names to the "Turf" table. The Turf table is then used to filter out incoming
messages. If incoming messages are from a user or domain in the Turf table, the
message is not delivered to the Exchange Server recipient. Instead, it is
deleted, or saved in a Turf directory. This directory is set by default in the
Exchange Server Administrator program to be C:\Turfdir. You can change this
location by adjusting the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\Services\MSExchangeIMC
   \Parameters\Turfdir

However, every time you add a domain or user to the Turf table through the
Message Filter in the Exchange Server Administrator program, the Turf directory
is reset to the default location. If the default location does not have a
Turfdir directory created, the messages will not be saved.

For more information on Turf tables and Turf directories, please see the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

   Q193926 XFOR: TURFDIR Must Be Manually Created for Message Filtering

RESOLUTION
