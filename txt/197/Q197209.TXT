SYMPTOMS
========

After you create a form to calculate a total, the Calculation form field is not
updated automatically.

CAUSE
=====

A possible cause is that the "Calculate on exit" option is not set for the form
fields that are referenced by the expression contained in the Calculation form
field.

RESOLUTION
==========

IMPORTANT NOTE: In some earlier versions of Microsoft Word, to update a
Calculation form field, you had to use a macro. However, in Microsoft Word 97,
you should use the "Calculate on exit" option to update your form fields. If you
have an Entry or Exit macro assigned to your form fields, you need to remove the
macro in the form field options of each of the form fields that the calculation
form field calculates.

To correct this problem, use the "Calculate on exit" option to update the
Calculation form field. To do this, follow these steps:

NOTE: The "Calculate on exit" option is set only on the form fields that you type
information into that are referenced by the expression of the Calculation form
field. The "Calculate on exit" check box has no effect if you set it in the
"Text Form Field Options" of a Calculation form field.

1. Unprotect your form. To do this, click Unprotect Document on the Tools menu.

2. Click to select a form field that is referenced in the expression of the
   Calculation form field.

   For example, if the expression of your Calculation form field is
   "Item1*Price1", click to select the form field named "Item1."

3. Right-click the selected form field, and click Properties on the shortcut
   menu that appears.

4. In the "Text Form Field Options" dialog box, select the Calculate on exit
   check box.

   NOTE: If you have an Entry or Exit macro assigned to this form field, clear
   the Entry or Exit macro. To do this, in either the Entry or Exit box, click
   the down arrow and click to select "(none)".

5. Click OK to close the "Text Form Field Options" dialog box.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for each form field referenced in the expression of your
   Calculation form field.

7. On the Tools menu, click Protect Document.

8. In the Protect Document dialog box, click to select Forms and click OK.
