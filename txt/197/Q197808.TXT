TITLE   :Domain Trust Relationship Cannot be Created
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51,4.0,4.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server versions 4.0, 4.5 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to establish a trust relationship between two domains that do
not replicate their respective Microsoft Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
databases, you receive the following error message:

   Could not find domain controller for this domain

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if a primary domain controller (PDC) cannot resolve
another PDC's <Domain name\0x1b> entry through WINS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you can create an LMHOSTS file on both primary domain
controllers to provide cross-domain name resolution capability. Each file must
contain the TCP/IP address and <Domain name\0x1b> entry for the opposite
controller. For information on creating the LMHOSTS file, see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

   Q180094 How to Write an LMHOSTS File for Domain Validation

After you create the LMHOSTS files, use the NBTSTAT -R command to preload the
entries into cache.

It is recommended that you also verify that the LMHOSTS lookup function is
enabled. You can do this by clicking Start, pointing to Settings, clicking
Control Panel, and then double-clicking Network. Click the Protocols tab,
double-click TCP/IP Protocol, click the WINS Address tab, and then click to
select the Enable LMHOSTS Lookup check box. Click OK, and then click Close.
