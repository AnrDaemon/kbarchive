SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when the contents of a header or footer in a document is
larger than half the page size, part of the header or footer will be truncated
(cut off).

CAUSE
=====

By default, Word will not allow a header or footer to be larger than half the
total page height.

For example, in a letter-sized document (8.5 x 11 inches) in portrait
orientation, the header or footer can be a maximum of 5.5 inches in height. In
landscape orientation, the header or footer can be a maximum 4.25 inches in
height.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set the header or footer to a fixed (absolute)
height. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Click to select the Margins tab.

3. In the Top Margin box, change the top margin to a negative value. For
   example, if your top margin is set to 1" (1 inch), change the top margin to
   -1" (-1 inch).
