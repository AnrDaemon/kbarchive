SUMMARY
=======

When you work with a document designed for forms data entry and "Save Data Only
for Forms" is selected, saving the data does not reflect the name change in the
forms document. To locate the "Save Data..." option, click Options on the Tools
menu, and then click the Save tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When working with forms fields, if you try to save data, Word prompts you for a
file name with .TXT as the default extension and Text Only as the default
conversion for the data file. The current forms document does not adopt the name
given this data-only file and this file name is not reflected in the Word title
bar if the "Save Data Only for Forms" option is selected.

By design, two entirely separate files exist:

 - The original forms document for entering the data.

   -and-

 - A text-only, comma-delimited file containing the data extracted from the
   forms fields.

This text-only data document contains no link to the original forms data entry
document.

This situation occurs because the current forms document you are working with is
used for form data entry only and the data is saved separately to a different
file, which can be used in data processing programs accepting comma-delimited,
text-only data format or for printing.

Currently there is no data link to the forms document. To create a link, you must
create a macro to extract the data from the original data document to fill the
form fields with the data.

Additional query words: forms
