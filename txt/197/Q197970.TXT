SUMMARY
=======

When you run the DS/IS Consistency Adjustment to re-populate the directory with
mailboxes contained inside the Information Store database, not all of the
default mailbox attributes are created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Running the DS/IS consistency adjuster may be necessary when performing a single
mailbox recovery.

The following default mailbox attributes are not created when you use DS/IS
consistency adjustment:

   Allow Rich Text
   Deliv-Ext-Cont-Types
   NT-Security-Descriptor
   Primary Windows NT Account
   Trust Level
   Use IS Defaults

In addition, the following non-default attribute is added:

   Hide From AB

These mailbox attributes will need to be updated as needed for each mailbox.

NOTE: Microsoft strongly urges Exchange administrators to review the
functionality of the DS/IS Consistency Adjuster before using it. The following
article explains the process and effects of running the DS/IS consistency
adjuster:
