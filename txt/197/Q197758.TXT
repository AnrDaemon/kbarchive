TITLE   :WD97: Cross-Reference Text Format Lost in Form Field Bookmark
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a cross-reference to the bookmark of a text form field contained
in a protected section, the resulting cross-reference text may not be correctly
formatted. This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

 - Manual formatting has been applied to the cross-reference field.

   -and-

 - You have typed multiple words into the text form field.

NOTE: Only the first word of the cross-reference text will contain the correct
formatting.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Modify the Cross-Reference Field Code
-----------------------------------------------

After you have applied formatting to the cross-reference field, turn on the field
codes. The field code should resemble the following:

   {ref Text1 \* MERGEFORMAT}

Change MERGEFORMAT to CHARFORMAT so that your cross-reference field now looks
like the following:

   {ref Text1 \* CHARFORMAT}

To turn your field codes on or off, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the View tab, select the Field Codes check box.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: A check mark in the check box indicates that the option is turned on.

Method 2: Apply a Style
-----------------------

Instead of manually formatting the cross-reference field, apply a style to the
field.

STATUS
======
