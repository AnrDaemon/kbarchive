TITLE   :FIX: FormatString Ignored for Fixed Columns in MSHFlexGrid
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbservicepack kbCtrl kbVBp kbVBp600bug kbGrpDSVB kbVS600sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you specify justification settings in the FormatString Property of the
Microsoft Hierarchical Flexgrid control, the justification is ignored for fixed
columns.

RESOLUTION
==========

Following are two alternatives, both of which have limitations:

 - If possible, use the Microsoft FlexGrid control. The FlexGrid control is not
   affected by this problem.

 - Avoid using fixed columns when using the Hierarchical FlexGrid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual Basic Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components and then select the Microsoft
   Hierarchical FlexGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB). Click OK.

3. Place an instance of the Hierarchical FlexGrid on Form1.

4. Place the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:

         Option Explicit

         Private Sub Form_Load()
            Dim strFormat As String
            ' The '^' in strFormat is a Center Justify instruction
            strFormat = "^AAA      |^BBBB      |^CCC      "
            MSHFlexGrid1.Rows = 10
            MSHFlexGrid1.Cols = 3
            For i = 0 To 9
               For j = 0 To 2
                  MSHFlexGrid1.TextMatrix(i, j) = "XXX"
               Next j
            Next i
            MSHFlexGrid1.FormatString = strFormat
         End Sub

5. Run the Project. Note that the justification does not take effect on the
   fixed column (that is, column 1.)
