KEYWORDS:word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The "Find whole words only" option is unavailable (dimmed) when you type more
than one word in the Find what box of the Find and Replace dialog box (on the
Edit menu).

CAUSE
=====

The use of the plural "words" in "Find whole words only" refers to finding
multiple instances of a word in the document.

WORKAROUND
==========

Select the Use wildcards check box when you want to find whole words and you are
searching for more than one word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Find whole words only" instructs Word to find complete words only, and not to
find words that only contain what you type. For example, if you type the word
"boat" in the Find what box and do not select "Find whole words only", Word
finds "boat", "boathouse", and "sailboat".
