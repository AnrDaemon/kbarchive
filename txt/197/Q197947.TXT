======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Active Directory Service Interfaces, version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to obtain network
computer information from within Visual FoxPro. This article shows an example of
how to obtain this information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: To use the following example, you must install the Active Directory
Service Interfaces from the following Web site or the Microsoft Developer
Network CD:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/Technical/directory/adsilinks.asp

ADSI is a COM-based interface for accessing directory services. You can treat
each element of the network, such as users, printers, and computers, as an
object. Accessing the properties of the computer object allows the developer to
get information about the computer. The following code demonstrates how to do
this. Save the following code to a program file and run the program.

Sample Code
-----------

   *-- Code begins here.
   *-- Change MyDomain and MyComputer to valid domain and computer names.
   oComputer = GetObject("WinNT://MyDomain/MyComputer")

   *-- Get the properties for the oComputer object and display them.
   lsInfo = "GUID:  " + oComputer.GUID + CHR(13) +;

            "Owner:  " + oComputer.Owner + CHR(13) +;
            "Division:  " + oComputer.Division + CHR(13) +;
            "Operating System:  " + oComputer.OperatingSystem + CHR(13) +;
            "OS Version:  " + oComputer.OperatingSystemVersion + CHR(13) +;
            "Processor:  " + oComputer.Processor + CHR(13) +;
            "Processor Count:  " + oComputer.ProcessorCount

   WAIT WINDOW lsInfo
   *-- Code ends here.
