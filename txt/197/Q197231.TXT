TITLE   :XFOR: Notes Connector Does Not Support "Flags" in Message
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


Messages marked with a flag in Microsoft Outlook will arrive in Lotus Notes by
means of the Exchange Notes Connector without any indication of such a flag in
Notes.

CAUSE
=====

A "flag" in a message normally indicates to the recipient that special attention
should be directed to this message. There is no equivalent in a Notes message to
the Outlook message flags.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because Lotus Notes lacks an equivalent feature, the Exchange Notes Connector
ignores the setting when translating the message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5.
