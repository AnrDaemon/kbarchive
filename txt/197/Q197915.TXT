TITLE   :PRB: Report Width is Larger than the Paper Width
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbReportWriter kbGrpDSVBDB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When printing or displaying a data report, the following error occurs:

   Report Width is Larger than the Paper Width.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the width of your report exceeds the maximum width
specified by the default printer.

When a report prints or displays the default printer settings in Control Panel
are used to determine the layout of the report. If your default printer
orientation is set up as Portrait and you design a report that extends beyond
8.5 inches wide, the preceding error occurs.

The width of the report is determined by taking the sum of the RightMargin,
LeftMargin and the ReportWidth. If this exceeds the width of your default
printer, the error occurs.

NOTE: The LeftMargin, RightMargin, and ReportWidth are denoted in twips.

   1440 twips equate to 1 inch.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem you need to check the following:

1. Make sure that there is no extra white space in the report. If there is any
   extra white space in the report, close up that section so that the ruler
   falls within the width of your default printer.

2. Set your LeftMargin and RightMargin to 0.

3. Check your printer setting to ensure that your default printer is set up
   correctly. If the report is landscape (that is, greater than 8.5 inches) the
   default printer should be set accordingly.

There is a .dll file named Pageset.dll that allows you to programmatically switch
the default printer orientation. For information on how to obtain this DLL,
please refer to the REFERENCES section of this article.
