SUMMARY
=======

There may be requirements for Microsoft Support Engineers to obtain a copy of
your Lotus Notes database for local reproduction of problems in working with
some Microsoft products. For example, Application Conversion Assistant and Lotus
Notes Connector. However, for many reasons, there is generally no need for you
to send the data in the database. This article describes the steps needed to get
the stripped down copy of the database. The article assumes a Notes R4.x client
as the interface.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To get the Notes database without the data, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Lotus Notes client.

2. Open the relevant Notes database.

3. On the File menu, click Database - New Copy.

4. The Server location can stay at the default "Local" location. Look for the
   Copy section in the dialog box.

5. Change the default selection from Database design and documents to Database
   design only.

6. Also clear the Access Control List option, otherwise you will have problems
   reading the database later. Do not select the Create Full Index option.

7. Make sure you know where the database is being created. If you are trying to
   make a second copy of a local database, you will have to select a different
   location for the database, or change the file name. By default, Notes will
   give the same filename, and when it tries to copy the database, it will error
   out indicating that a copy exists already.

Additional query words: Notes database design, replica, copy
