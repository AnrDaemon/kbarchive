TITLE   :SYSDIFF /INF Uses Decimal Format for REG_DWORD Values
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an .inf file from a SYSDIFF package, registry values in the
package will be 0 after running the .inf file when the value in the .inf file is
bigger than 2147483647.

CAUSE
=====

When a registry entry contained in a SNAP file is written to an .inf file using
the SYSDIFF /INF syntax, REG_DWORD values are written in decimal form. For
example, 0x80000010 is written as 2147483664.

When Setupapi.dll runs this .inf file, it checks whether decimal REG_DWORD values
exceed 2147483647 and writes 0 to the registry. SETUPAPI checks the value
because all decimal values are supposed to be signed integers and, therefore, an
overflow occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========
