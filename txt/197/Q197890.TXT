TITLE   :Cannot Overwrite ISAPI Extensions in Stopped Web Site
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 does not allow you to copy new ISAPI
extensions over older ISAPI extensions in Web sites even though the Web sites
are stopped in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the IIS Admin Service is still running and is
holding a lock on the ISAPI file even though the Web site is stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========

To stop the IIS Admin Service, follow these steps:

1. Open Control Panel.

2. Double-click Services.

3. Click the IIS Admin Service, and then click Stop.

4. You are presented with a list of services that depend on the IIS Admin
   Service. Write down all the services listed, and then click OK.

5. After the Service Manager shuts down all the services, click each service
   that you wrote down in step 4, and then click Start.

6. Click Close.
