TITLE   :WD97: "Find Whole Words Only" and "Match Case" Are Unavailable
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows

OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The "Find Whole Words Only" and "Match Case" options are unavailable (dimmed)
when you click to select Use Wildcards.

CAUSE
=====

Selecting Use Wildcards actually has the effect of turning on these other
options. When you type text in the Find What box and select Use Wildcards, Word
matches the case of the typed words and finds only whole words.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can override these implied options by using Advanced Search Criteria. For
example, to search for a word that may appear in the document as "JONES",
"Jones", or "jones", select the Use Wildcards check box, and type the following
in the Find What box:

   "[Jj][Oo][Nn][Ee][Ss]" (without the quotation marks)

Including each uppercase and lowercase pair in brackets tells Word to search for
either letter in that position.

REFERENCES
