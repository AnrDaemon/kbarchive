======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Windows NT, multiple windows may open. When this occurs, one
window opens for each file or folder in the root folder on the hard disk.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is no string data assigned to the Common
Startup value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ 
      User Shell Folders

This value points to the folder from which the Startup group items for the All
Users profile are to be run. If this value is not present, Windows NT assumes
that all files and folders in the root folder on the hard disk on which Windows
NT is installed must be opened.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue, add the string data "%SystemRoot%\Profiles\All Users\Start
Menu\Programs\Startup" to the Common Startup value in the following registry
key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ 
      User Shell Folders

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
