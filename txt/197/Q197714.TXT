SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a mailbox through Outlook Web Access using Internet Explorer
4.01 and the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) computer configured to
use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (https://), the following dialog box may appear
when opening a message:

   This page contains both secure and non-secure items. Do you want to download
   the non-secure items?

   Yes No More Info

Selecting Yes opens the message and any subsequent messages. Selecting No causes
the dialog box to go away but the message opens anyway. Selecting More Info
displays the following information:

   Downloading insecure content from a secure Web site

   The Web site you are viewing is a secure Web site. It uses a security protocol
   such as SSL or Private Communications Technology (PCT) to secure information
   you send and receive. However, this Web page contains items from other Web
   sites that are not secure.

   Given what you know about this Web site and your computer, you must decide
   whether to proceed with downloading the insecure items. If, given this
   information, you still do not feel confident about installing this software,
   then click No.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem was fixed in Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1.

If you access the mailbox by means of Outlook Web Access using Internet Explorer
4.01 with Service Pack 1 applied, the dialog box does not appear.
