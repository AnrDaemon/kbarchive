TITLE   :Printing Multiple Copies of the Same Job Via LPD Broken in SP4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you submit a print job from a UNIX system to a Windows NT LPD server, you
can specify an option to print multiple copies. When using Windows NT Service
Pack 4 (SP4), only one copy is printed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, the control characters "K" or "#" should be used to
specify printing multiple copies.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 supports two non-RFC 1179 extensions for the LPD control file. If
the format control character ("f") is sent multiple times, the file is printed
multiple times. Also the "K" or "#" control characters can be used to specify
printing multiple copies.

   Example: (bsd-style printing)
   lpr -Pprinter -#2 <file>

In Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, only one copy is printed even when there are
multiple "f" commands in the control file.
