Many Windows applications that use toolbars retain the position of the toolbars
between instances. This functionality creates a more user-friendly application.
While Visual FoxPro does not natively provide this functionality, it is possible
using the code provided in this sample.

This sample demonstrates how to create a toolbar that remembers its positions
between instances of its parent form. Two methods are shown:

 - Using a table to store the positions. -and-

 - Using the Windows registry.

NOTE: If you use this sample between Visual FoxPro 5.0 and Visual FoxPro 6.0, be
sure to rebuild the project and recompile all files before running the forms.
You may receive errors when rebuilding the project in Visual FoxPro 5.0 such as
"Unable to find UNKNOWN NEWOBJECT". You can ignore these messages.
