TITLE   :SP4 Blue Screen Occurs on Reboot If Hardware Key Used
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and restarting a computer that
uses a HASP hardware key (dongle) on the parallel port for QuarkXPress or other
proprietary software products protected by the key, a kernel mode exception
occurs during the restart process, and a Stop 0x0000001E blue screen results.

CAUSE
=====

Some drivers for the HASP hardware key (dongle) required by QuarkXPress and
other key-protected products are incompatible with SP4.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the latest HASP drivers before installing SP4. Any driver version later
than 3.7 will work.

If the problem is encountered after installing SP4 and rebooting, you must remove
the existing driver. If you have a multiple boot system and one of the other
operating systems can access the system directory for the affected boot, you can
boot on that other operating system and remove the Haspnt.sys file from the
System32\Drivers folder in the Windows NT system directory. If you do not have
multiple boots that permit this, you must install Windows NT temporarily in
another folder, log on to the temporary installation, and delete the file.
