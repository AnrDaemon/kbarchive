TITLE   :WD97: Replace Within Selection Continues to End of Document
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you are performing a find-and-replace operation on a selection and choose
Replace All after having chosen Replace or Find Next, Word continues replacing
past the selection to the end of the document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you select a range of text and then, in the Replace dialog box, click Replace
All or any combination of Replace and Find Next, replacing only takes place
within the selection. You then see a dialog box asking if you want to continue
replacing beyond the selection.

If, however, you select a range of text and then click Replace or Find Next,
followed by Replace All in the Replace dialog box, Word does not stop after the
selection but replaces to the end of the document.
