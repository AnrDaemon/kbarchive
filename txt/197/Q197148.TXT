SUMMARY
=======

The ruler in Word 97 is accessible only by using a mouse.



MORE INFORMATION
================

As the result of customer feedback, Microsoft increased the functionality of the
ruler starting with Word 6.0. To prevent too much complexity, the additional
mouse functionality required a loss of keyboard functionality. As a result,
there is no longer a ruler mode you can activate to allow setting tabs and
indents directly from the keyboard.

New functions and changes to the ruler:

 - The indent and margin modes were combined.

 - You automatically switch to table mode when in a table.

 - Page layout view now has a vertical ruler.

 - You can set all indents using the mouse without keyboard intervention.
   (Previously you had to hold down the SHIFT key to drag the body indent
   triangle.)

 - You can choose the type of tab from the ruler.

 - The visual style has been improved to make it easier to use.

To set all paragraph settings using the keyboard, click either Paragraph or Tabs
on the Format menu.
