The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The MS Loopback Adapter is a valuable tool for testing in a virtual network
environment where access to a network is not feasible. Also, MS Loopback is
essential if there are conflicts with a network card or a network adapter
driver. Network clients, protocols, and so on, can be bound to MS Loopback and
then the network adapter driver, or network adapter, can be installed at a later
time, but the network configuration information will still be retained. The MS
Loopback Adapter can be installed during the unattended installation process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Modify the Unattend.txt file as follows to install only the MS Loopback Adapter
and not to detect a network adapter on the target system:

      [Network]
      InstallAdapters = AdaptersList
      InstallProtocols = ProtocolsSection
      JoinWorkgroup = MyGroup
      DoNotInstallInternetServer = Yes

      [AdaptersList]
      LOOP = LOOPParamSection

      [LOOPParamSection]

If you are installing the TCP/IP protocol, specify the following settings:

      [ProtocolsSection]
      TC = TCParameters

      [TCParameters]
      DHCP = No
      IPAddress = 10.10.10.1
      Subnet = 255.255.255.0
