======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you package a Microsoft Visual Basic application with the Package and
Deployment Wizard (PDW), the following message appears:

   The wizard found dependency information for the listed files, but the
   information is out of date. To proceed with the out-of-date information,
   click OK.

This article applies to Visual Basic applications that reference the Microsoft
Calendar Control (MSCal.ocx).

CAUSE
=====

The version number for MSCal.ocx is 8.0.0.5007, but the version listed in
MSCal.dep is 8.0.32.29.

RESOLUTION
==========

The issue may be resolved by changing the version number in MSCal.dep from
8.0.32.29 to 8.0.0.5007.

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. Locate the MSCal.dep file. Under Windows NT or Windows 2000, this file is in
   the \Winnt\System32 directory. Under Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me,
   this file is in the \Windows\System directory.

2. Open MSCal.dep in a text editor such as Notepad.

3. Scroll down until you see the following:

      [MSCAL.OCX]
      Dest=$(WinSysPath)
      Register=$(DLLSelfRegisterEx)
      Version=8.0.32.29
      Uses1=

4. Change the line that says "Version=8.0.32.29" to "Version=8.0.0.5007."

In addition to updating the "Version=" setting in MSCal.dep, if the "Register="
setting is "$(DllSelfRegisterEx)", you must change it to "$(DllSelfRegister)".

STATUS

This behavior is by design.
