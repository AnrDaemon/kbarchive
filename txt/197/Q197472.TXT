TITLE   :WD97: Default Numbering in PAGE Field Doesn't Change Default
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfield winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you select Use Default Numbering in the PAGE Field Options dialog box and
then click Add To Field, the following message may appear:

   This action will not change the default page number format. To change the
   default page number format for this section, use Insert Page Number and
   choose the Format button.

Clicking OK three times will insert the Page Number Field.

CAUSE
=====

When you select the Use Default Numbering setting, Word uses the default page
number format that you set in the Page Numbers command on the Insert menu. No
field switch is associated with the default setting. Word uses the default
numbering setting regardless of whether you select Use Default Numbering in the
PAGE Field Options dialog box.

By design, the Use Default Numbering setting confirms that you want to use the
default settings.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you insert a PAGE field using the Field command on the Insert menu, you do
not need to click Options and change any settings in the PAGE Field Options
dialog box if you want to use the default page number settings for the current
section.

The only time you need to change the settings in the PAGE Field Options dialog
box is when you want to change the page number formatting from the default
settings for the current section.

Additional query words: numbering blank 8.0 8.00
