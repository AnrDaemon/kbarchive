TITLE   :Informix IDS Does Not Start After Installing Service Pack 4
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) on a computer that already
has Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) version 7.2 or earlier installed, the IDS
Insure database service may not start.

CAUSE
=====

The IDS Insure database service is attempting to write to the Event Viewer
security log without the proper security privilege. Fixes included in the latest
service pack require that a process acquire the "Manage auditing and security
log" right before attempting to write to the security log.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you can:

 - Grant the "Manage auditing and security log" right to the user or group,
   including a System Account, that requires write access to the security log.
   This right is granted by default to the Administrators group, but it is not
   explicitly added to any other user or group.

 - Acquire the SE_SECURITY_PRIVILEGE before calling RegisterEventSource() in
   your source code to write to the security log or write log data to a
   different log that is not restricted.
