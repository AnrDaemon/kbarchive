-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

New tools can be added to the toolbar for Internet Service Manager (ISM) for
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), or the Internet Services Manager
snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). This allows you to add
existing tools or custom add-ons for the ISM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

IIS allows adding new tools to the menu by making string entries in the following
registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\INetMgr\Parameters\AddOnTools

All entries use the following format:

   "<value name>" = "<path and executable> ; <Tool Tip> ;
   [<optional parameters>]"

If you chose to install the FrontPage Extensions, the following example shows you
how to add the FrontPage Server Administrator to the ISM or IIS snap-in MMC
toolbar.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\INetMgr\Parameters\AddOnTools

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
   value:

      Value Name: FrontPage Server Administrator
      Data Type : REG_SZ
      Value     : <path to fpsrvwin.exe>;FrontPage Server Administrator

   NOTE: The file Fpsrvwin.exe is usually found in the following path:

   <drive>:\Program Files\Microsoft FrontPage\Version <x>.0\bin

   where <drive> is where you installed the FrontPage tools, and <x>
   is the version number of FrontPage.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Close and then reopen the ISM or MMC.
