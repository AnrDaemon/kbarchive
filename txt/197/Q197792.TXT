======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Service may stop working, and log error 4116 or others in the
event log, such as event 4116, or it may Dr. Watson on store.exe. This may be
because a message is stuck in the Internet Mail Service queues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correct for messages stuck in the Internet Mail Service queues follow these
steps:

1. In the Control Panel, double-click Services, and then stop the Internet Mail
   Service.

2. Locate the exchsrvr\Imcdata directory. You can verify this, by checking the
   registry under the following key:

   HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\RootDir

3. Create a temporary directory named "TempIMS" (without the quotation marks)
   under \Imcdata.

4. In the Exchsrvr\Imcdata directory, delete the Queue.dat file.

5. Copy the two directories, Imcdata\IN and Imcdata\OUT, to the TempIMS
   directory.

6. Delete all the files in the Imcdata\IN and Imcdata\OUT directories.


7. Clear out the MAPI queues in MTS-IN and MTS-OUT in the information store.
   Otherwise, if there are mailboxes on the Exchange Server computer, you need
   to use one of the following utilities: Gwclean, Profinst, or Mdbvu32.

   If you use Mdbvu32, run the Profinst program to install the MAPI profile to be
   used by Mdbvu32.

8. After you clear the queues, restart the information store and the Internet
   Mail Service. If this fails, check the message transfer agent (MTA) queues.
   Run the "mtacheck /V /F <filename>.txt" (without the quotation marks)
   command. You may want to use the /rd or /rl switches.

9. Replay the messages; stop the Internet Mail Service, delete the Queue.dat
   file, copy the files from TempIMC\IN and TempIMC\OUT to the corresponding
   directories under Imcdata\IN and Imcdata\OUT, and then restart the Internet
   Mail Service.
