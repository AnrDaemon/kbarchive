TITLE   :CopyProxy Does Not Make a Copy for Dual Interfaces
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you call CoCopyProxy API on a proxy for a custom (automation) interface that
is marshalled by the automation marshaller (Oleaut32.dll), the API will return
the following error:

   S_OK

However, no copy will be made.

If you build a proxy/stub .dll for the same interface and use it as the
marshaller, the API CoCopyProxy() works.

CAUSE
=====

The old code had the assumption that CreateProxy returned a valid interface
parameter, which is not TRUE for automation proxies. Automation proxies return
the interface pointer only after the channel is connected.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
