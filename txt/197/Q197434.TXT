TITLE   :WD97: Cannot Mark Citation That Does Not Include Short Citation
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield word97

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Mark button is unavailable (dimmed) in the Mark Citation dialog box until
you type some text in the Short Citation box. This means you cannot create a TA
(Table of Authorities Entry) field in Word using only the long citation. (To
locate the Mark Citation dialog box, click Indexes And Tables on the Insert
menu, select the Table Of Authorities tab, and then click Mark Citation.)

WORKAROUND
==========

If you want to create a table of authorities entry that does not include a short
citation, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, click Index And Tables, and then select the Table of
   Authorities tab.

2. Click OK.

3. Turn the Field Codes on by pressing ALT+F9.

4. Modify the TA field manually.

For example, to remove the short citation from the following TA field, delete "
\s "Short Citation"":

   { TA \l "This is the long version of the citation." \s "Short Citation" \c 3 }

The following is the modified TA field, which no longer contains a short
citation:

   { TA \l "This is the long version of the citation." \c 3 }

IMPORTANT: You should not use this workaround for documents that you plan to open
in WordPerfect. Table of authorities entries that do not contain a short
citation may cause a general protection (GP) fault error in WordPerfect.
