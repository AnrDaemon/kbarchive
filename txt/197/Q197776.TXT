SUMMARY
=======

Pagefiles are limited to 4,095 MB in size under Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Computers can hold large amounts of physical RAM, which has become more common.
Up to 4 GB of RAM have been seen in installations of computers running Windows
NT 4.0 Terminal Server and Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition. These servers may
require over 12 GB of pagefile space. Unfortunately there is a size limit of
4,095 MB on a single pagefile and only one pagefile is allowed for each logical
partition.

For these large memory computers, the workaround is to divide up one or more
large physical drives into 4 GB logical drives and use the entire logical drive
as a pagefile. The administrator may create as many pagefiles as needed.

You can also reassign the drive letters to high values and use the following
article to hide them from the users. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
