SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a caption in a document that includes chapter numbering in the
caption numbers, captions whose \r switches you modified are reset to 1.

CAUSE
=====

When you select the Include Chapter Numbers option, Word replaces the existing
captions with new ones, overwriting any changes you made to the SEQ fields in
the captions.

This behavior does not occur when the caption does not include the chapter
number.

Word does not put the \r switch in the first SEQ field for a caption sequence
when including chapter numbers. Instead, Word adds the \s switch to the SEQ
field to reset the sequence number. However, the \r switch can be added to the
SEQ field in place of the \s switch to reset the sequence number of that caption
sequence. If the \r switch is added, and another caption is inserted into that
caption sequence, Word refreshes the caption sequence, removes the \r switch,
and adds the \s switch back in.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this situation, change the restart information only after all the
captions have been inserted. To set or change a caption sequence starting
number, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the View tab.

2. Click to select the Field Codes check box, and then click OK.

3. In the SEQ field, place the insertion point at the end of the field (to the
   left of the closing field bracket) and replace \s 1 with "\r n" (without the
   quotation marks), where "n" is the number you want to begin the sequence.
