TITLE   :Full-screen DOS Window Is Split with Some Number 9 Video Cards
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting a full-screen command prompt on some Number Nine video adapters may
result in a split-screen doubling of the full screen.


CAUSE
=====

Vga.sys needs to set the character cell height for the MS-DOS mode. Character
cell height is held in the lower 5 bits of the VGA register CR9. However,
Vga.sys destroys the upper 3 bits of CR9 when writing the character cell height
into the lower 5 bits of the register. The state of one of those upper three
bits is required by the flat-panel MS-DOS mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
