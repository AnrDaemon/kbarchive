SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows includes a command to automatically scroll while
you read your document. This article describes the AutoScroll command and how to
add the command in Word.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AutoScroll command automatically scrolls your document either down or up at
a slow speed while you read or review your document. When you first start the
AutoScroll command, Word starts scrolling down your document at a very slow
pace.

To control the speed and direction that Word scrolls through your document, move
your mouse. In the vertical scroll bar of your document window, large arrow
heads indicate the direction of scrolling. The farther away from the center of
the vertical scroll bar these arrows are moved, the faster your document
scrolls.

To stop the automatic scrolling of your document, either click once with your
mouse or press the ESC key on your keyboard.

NOTE: Automatic scrolling of your document cannot be used when you are editing,
typing, or selecting text. If you attempt to make changes in the document, the
AutoScroll command is stopped. If you switch away from your active document (for
example, use ALT+TAB keys to switch to another application), the AutoScroll
command is stopped.

To Add the AutoScroll Command
-----------------------------

1. Start Word and a new, blank document. If you want this command to be
   available for certain documents, open the template for those documents.

2. On the Tools menu, click Customize.

3. On the Commands tab, under Categories, select All commands.

4. Under Commands, select AutoScroll and then drag the AutoScroll command to a
   menu or toolbar.
   NOTE: Make sure that the template you want to store this change in is selected
   in the Save In box. If it is not selected, click the down arrow of the Save
   In box and select the template you want to save this change in. If the
   template you want is not listed in the drop-down list, click Cancel to close
   the Customize dialog box, open your template, and repeat these steps. For
   additional information, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:

5. Click Close to close the Customize dialog box.

6. Close your active documents or templates. If you are prompted to save the
   changes, be sure to answer Yes. If you answer No, then the addition of the
   AutoScroll command to your menu or toolbar will be lost. When you exit Word,
   if you are prompted to save your global template, be sure to answer Yes.
