TITLE   :WD97: Rotated or Flipped Text in Macpict Graphic Seems Distorted
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Word for Windows, if you edit a Macpict graphic that contains rotated or
flipped text, or if the graphic itself is rotated, the rotated or flipped text
or graphic may appear distorted or coarse.

NOTE: To create a Macpict graphic, use the Word for the Macintosh picture editor.

CAUSE
=====

The Word for Windows picture editor does not support rotated or flipped text. If
you edit a Macpict graphic, Word transforms the rotated text into two
superimposed components, namely an unrotated text image and a bitmap image of
the rotated text. The superimposed images appear distorted.

This distortion may worsen if you scale the graphic more than 5 percent of its
original size.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
