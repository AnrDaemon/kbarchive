SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that it takes several seconds longer to open an Access MDB file
stored on a Windows NT Server computer than if the same MDB is stored on a

CAUSE

This problem occurs because the Windows NT Server computer is not optimized for
file sharing.

2. Double-click the Network icon.

3. Click the Services tab.

4. Double-click the Server Service.

5. Click to select the Maximize Throughput For File Sharing radio button.

6. Restart the server.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION

performance returns to normal.
