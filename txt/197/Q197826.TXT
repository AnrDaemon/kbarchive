KEYWORDS:kbualink97 word97

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot apply underline character formatting to a line that contains only
spaces. If you attempt to apply this type of formatting to a space character,
the underline is not displayed or printed.

CAUSE
=====

There must be at least one character other than a space at the end of a line for
underline formatting to appear. Similarly, underline character formatting does
not appear on spaces following the last character on a line.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following procedures to extend an underline past the end of text
on a line:

 - Type at least one non-breaking space at the end of the line where you want
   the underline to stop. To type a non-breaking space, press
   CTRL+SHIFT+SPACEBAR.

   -or-

 - Set a right-aligned tab stop at the position where you want the underline to
   stop. Apply underline formatting to the tab.

   -or-

 - Set a right-aligned tab stop with a solid, underscore leader. To do this,
   click to select the Leader 4 option button in the Tabs dialog box (Format
   menu).

If you apply hidden and underline character formatting to text, the underline
formatting appears on the screen, but it is not displayed in print preview nor
is it printed.
