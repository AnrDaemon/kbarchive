KEYWORDS:kbdta kbfield word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, any fields inserted from menus or by pressing CTRL+F9 include
a space at the beginning and a space at the end. Earlier versions of Word do not
include these extra spaces.

This may be a problem if a macro written for an earlier version of Word searches
for a field code using ^19fieldname.

RESOLUTION
==========

To find fields, the search must be modified to include a space between ^19 and
the field name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The extra spaces are provided for ease of reading the contents of the field.
