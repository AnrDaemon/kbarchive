SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up deploying from Visual SourceSafe through a
firewall.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When setting up a Web project that needs to be deployed outside of your
firewall, there are two things that have to be set up. First of all you need to
have a Web project in order to deploy the project. In order to set a project as
a Web project, please follow the instructions in the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q194826 HOWTO: Designate a Visual SourceSafe project as a Web Project

In the SourceSafe Administrator, under the Tools menu, select Options. Click the
Web Tab. This tab sets up the settings for deploying a Web project to a remote
server that is located outside the firewall.

The setting, "Proxy for deploying over ftp:," expects the address of the proxy
server that is going to be deployed through. The setting may have to be entered
as an IP address instead of the DNS (Domain Name System) name for it to work
correctly. This setting, depending on your internal network, may require you to
enter the protocol as well, for example:

ftp://123.45.67.123

When deploying through a FTP proxy, port 21 is used.

For example, if ftp://123.45.67.123:27 is the proxy server address, port 21 will
be used instead of the specified port 27.
