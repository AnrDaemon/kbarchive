TITLE   :SBS Client Setup Will Not Run After Reboot
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:Windows:95; WinNT:4.0,4.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork sbs

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
 - Microsoft Windows 98 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Small Business Server (SBS) client setup application configures a new
workstation to join the SBS domain, but does not install client applications
after rebooting.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because of any of the following:

 - The user is not set up to use a logon script.

 - The user does not have permission to run the logon script.

 - The logon script does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

Any user created through the console will be set up to use a logon script. This
setting can be verified from User Manager for Domains by following these steps:

1. Select the user.

2. Press ENTER to view properties.

3. Click Profiles.

4. Verify that the logon script name is SmallBusiness\<username>.bat.

5. Verify that this file exists in the following folder:
   %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts\SmallBusiness

6. If the logon script is missing, copy it from

   c:\smallbusiness\template\template.bat

   to

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts\SmallBusiness\<username>.bat

7. In the Manager Server Console, run the software setup for this user and his
   or her computer again.

8. Verify that the user has read permission on the scripts folder, the
   Smallbusiness folder, and the <username>.bat file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The user's logon script is stored under the following folder:

   %SystemRoot%\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts

By default, this folder should be shared out as Netlogon and the Everyone group
should have read permission to both the share and the folder.

The scripts folder should contain a SmallBusiness folder. The Everyone group
should have read permission on this folder.

In the SmallBusiness folder, there should be a batch file named after each user
for which a client workstation has been set up. This batch file starts the
client application installation program and sets the parameters for that
installation.
