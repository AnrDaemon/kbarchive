TITLE   :XADM: JET Retry Hotfix Makes Repair (ESEUTIL /P) Very Slow
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the fix detailed in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article, running repair (ESEUTIL /P) is considerably slower than before the fix
was in place.

   Q192333 XADM: JET Will Now Retry 16 Times on -1018 Error

CAUSE
=====

The second phase of repair is to scan every page in the database. During this
scan, the Exchange Server database engine expects to encounter un- initialized
pages. Un-initialized pages are zeroed out pages that have not been used yet.
When an un-initialized page are encountered, a -1019 error
(JET_errPageNotInitialized -- Blank database page) is generated in the Windows
NT Application Event log, but repair is expecting that error.

However, when the hotfix Ese.dll (in the article listed above) sees an un-
initialized page, it retries the read 16 times. Retrying the reads for each
un-initialized page in the database slows the scanning phase considerably.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

later:

   Component: Exchange Database Engine

   File Name   Version
   ----------------------
   Ese.dll     5.5.2416.0


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
