TITLE   :WD97: Conditional MERGEFIELD Lost When Converted to MacWord
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbfield kbmerge

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a mail merge main document containing conditional MERGEFIELD
statements as a Word for the Macintosh 4.0 or 5.x document, the information in
the conditional MERGEFIELD statement is lost.

WORKAROUND
==========

Re-create the conditional MERGEFIELD statement after you open the mail merge
main document in Word.

NOTE: You may need to reattach the data document when you open the mail merge
main document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The conversion process does not correctly handle the conditional MERGEFIELD
statement. For example, if the statement in Word 97 is

      {IF {MERGEFIELD LastName}="Jones" "yes" "no"}

the same statement after opening the converted document in Word for the Macintosh
5.1 appears as:

      <<IF=>><<ENDIF>>

When you reopen the converted document back into Word, the conditional MERGEFIELD
statement shows as:

         {IF= "" ""}

Additional query words: conditional print constructs field 8.0 8.00
