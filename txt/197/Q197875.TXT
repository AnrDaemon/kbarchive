TITLE   :XWEB: OWA Send Note Applet Doesn't Display Scroll Bars, Buttons
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use the Send Note function of Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), the
scroll bars and the "Send" or "Check Names" buttons of the Send Note applet may
disappear.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the browser is running in a 640x480 pixels display mode. The
Send Note applet is too large for the browser to display in 640x480 mode. Use
the scroll bars on the browser to allow the entire Send Note page to scroll in
and out of view.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the display setting to be at least 800x600 pixels.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the browser scroll bars to view information that has been moved off of the
screen, or change the display setting to at least 800x600 pixels.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The browser will not scroll with text because it is being added in the Send Note
applet. Instead the scroll bars in the applet will be used to navigate the text
being entered.
