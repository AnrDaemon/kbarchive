PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER:WINNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the HTMLA Web Administration forms in Internet Information Server,
if you click the properties of a Web site and view the home directory section,
it appears that you can modify the application starting point entry. However,
you cannot edit the information found in this field.

CAUSE
=====

The field appears to be modifiable because the Web Administration forms are
created using HTML 3.0.

This behavior is by design.


Additional query words: Admin
