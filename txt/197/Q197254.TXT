SUMMARY
=======

The display names and alias names for custom recipients that were created when
directory synchronization was performed between Exchange Server and Lotus
cc:Mail can be customized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The name rule will contain the following name components:

   Rule    Name Component
   %F      firstname
   %L      lastname
   %I      Initials

%#(rule) Specifies the number of characters for the name. For example, the format
%2F for the name Nick would generate Ni.

You can also add a string to the end of the rule. This string will be appended to
the display name. For example, the rule "%L, %F - CCMail" will generate a
display name for John Doe as Doe, John -CCMail.

The alias name can be changed from the default (First name and first letter of
the last name) by performing the following steps:
