TITLE   :WinNT Does Not Boot to Partition That Starts More Than 4 GB
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp5fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

X86-based computers running Windows NT do not start if the "multi()" syntax is
used in the Boot.ini file and the first sector of the partition to which Windows
NT is installed is 4 GB or more into the disk. That is, if the cumulative size
of other partitions and unpartitioned free space before the partition to which
Windows NT is installed is greater than or equal to 4 GB.

One of the following error messages is displayed in this situation:

   Boot record signature AA55 not found (25EB found) Windows NT could not start
   because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem. Could not read
   from the selected boot disk. Check boot path and disk hardware. Please check
   the Windows NT documentation about hardware disk
   configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional information.

   Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
   <Windows NT Root>\System32\Ntoskrnl.exe

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a miscalculation that takes place during the boot
sequence where Windows NT is attempting to compute the starting location of the
partition to which Windows NT is installed.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


To resolve this issue if you received an error message about a missing
Ntoskrnl.exe file, extract a new copy of this file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem can be avoided by using the "scsi()" syntax in the Boot.ini file
because a different code-path is invoked that does not include the mathematical
errors encountered when using the "multi()" syntax. For more information about
the Boot.ini file, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
