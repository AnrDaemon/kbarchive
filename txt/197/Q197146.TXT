======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Domain Naming Service (DNS) on your computer running Windows
NT Server, you may receive the following error:

   System Error 2: "The system cannot find the file specified"

The DNS service will then terminate and you will receive the following events in
your event log:

   EventID: 1000
   Source: DNS
   Type: Error
   Description: DNS Server could not open the file dns\<zone-file-name>.
   The data is the error.
   Data: (grayed out)

   EventID: 1004
   Source: DNS
   Type: Error
   Description: DNS Server could not find or open database file dns\<zone-
   file-name>.
   Data: 0000: 02 00 00 00 (in bytes)

   EventID: 7023
   Source: Service Control Manager
   Type: Error
   Description: The Microsoft DNS Server service terminated with the
   following error: The system cannot find the file specified.
   Data: (grayed out)

CAUSE
=====

The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CCS\Services\DNS\Zones registry key still has a
subfolder/key for the zone but the zone file of <zone-file-name> is
missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

Either remove the zone subkey or subkeys referenced in the event log or create
the zone file with correct format and proper information under
%SystemRoot%\system32\dns.
