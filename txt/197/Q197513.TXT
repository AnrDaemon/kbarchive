SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT is limited to four gigabytes (GB) of random access memory (RAM).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, each program is allocated two GB of RAM by the Windows NT kernel when
the program is loaded. Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition makes use of 4
Gigabyte Memory Tuning (4GT). This allows programs to use one more GB of RAM,
increasing the memory available to the program to three GB.

For additional information about 4GT, view the following Microsoft Web site:
