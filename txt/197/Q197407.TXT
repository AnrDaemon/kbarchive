TITLE   :PC Adm: Dirsync Events Not Scheduled Properly in Year 2000
PRODUCT :Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbYear2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Mail for PC Networks does not recognize the year 2000 as a leap year.
If you attempt to use the Administrator program to schedule a directory
synchronization (dirsync) event to occur on February 29, 2000, the event is not
scheduled properly. This may cause unnecessary or undesired events to occur on
February 29, 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   File Name   Date       Size
   ------------------------------------
   Admin.exe   12-08-98   535,869 bytes

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Admy2k.exe:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/pcmail-public/All-Y2K/


WORKAROUND
==========

If you scheduled dirsync events to occur on February 29, 2000, before applying
the fix, follow these steps to work around the problem:

1. Delete or rename the Process.glb file.

2. Install a new postoffice on another computer, and then copy the Process.glb
   file from the new postoffice to the original postoffice.

3. Use the Administrator program to schedule the events again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
version 3.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you configure a directory requestor postoffice to send all address list
changes to the directory server postoffice (T1 event) or incorporate the changes
received from the directory server postoffice (T3 event) on February 29, 2000,
the event is saved to the Process.glb file. However, the event is appended to
the end of the file, instead of being added to the existing record for that day
of the week. This may cause the Dispatch program (Dispatch.exe) to run multiple
times on that day of the week.
