TITLE   :XFOR: Dirsync Does Not Correctly Convert Date to UTC Format
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:exc55sp2fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The directory synchronization (dirsync) service may not convert dates to
coordinated universal time (Universal Time Coordinate, or UTC) correctly. As a
result, if the logging level for the dirsync service is set to Maximum, the date
and time may be displayed incorrectly in one or more events that appear in the
event log. When the date and time are displayed in UTC format in the event
description, the year may be displayed as one digit instead of two.

Note that this problem is not likely to occur before the year 2000. When the
problem does occur, the dirsync service functions normally except for the
symptoms described above. Therefore, you are still able to perform directory
synchronization successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

   Component: Directory Synchronization (Dirsync)

   File Name   Version
   ----------------------
   Dxa.exe     5.5.2404.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The UTC format uses the following syntax:

   YYMMDDhhmmssZ

where:

 - YY = Year

 - MM = Month

 - DD = Day

 - hh = Hour

 - mm = Minutes

 - ss = Seconds

 - Z represents "Zulu" (same as Greenwich mean time)

Each component of the date and time are normally displayed as two digits. For
example, if an event is recorded in the event log at 3:11:46 A.M. on December
31, 1999, the date and time are displayed in the following format in the event
description:

   991231031146Z

However, if an event is recorded at 3:11:46 A.M. on December 31, 2000, the date
and time may be displayed in the following format:

   01231031146Z

Note that the year is displayed as one digit instead of two.
