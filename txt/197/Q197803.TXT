TITLE   :WD97: High Network Traffic When Using Large Tables (Novell)
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience heavy network traffic when you have large tables in your
document and the document is accessed over a Novell network.

CAUSE
=====

Large tables can cause a lot of network traffic on a Novell network because
Novell network drivers do not allow caching.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1: Increase the Word Cache (Cache Size)
----------------------------------------------

This may reduce the number of read requests needed for large table access. To
increase the word cache from a default amount of 64 kilobytes (KB), you need to
load the Support8.dot template and then run the RegOptions macro. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Templates And Add-Ins.

2. Click Add. Select the following folder:

   Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Macros

   NOTE: This is the default folder where Support8.dot will be placed. If you did
   a Typical installation, this template is not installed and you must run Setup
   again to add these templates. For additional information, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q120802 Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or Component

3. Select the Support8 template (Support8.dot). Click OK twice.

4. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

5. Click to select the RegOptions macro, and then click Run.

6. Click the Word 8.0 Options tab. Click to select CacheSize. In the Setting
   box, type "1024" (without the quotation marks). Click OK.

7. Quit and restart Word.

For administrative purposes, and for new Word installations only, you can also
set the following registry value:

   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\New User Settings\Word\Options
    CacheSize

Depending on the size of the tables involved, increasing this value to 512 (or
even 1024) will, in most cases, be sufficient.

Method 2: Split the Table into Multiple One-Page Tables
-------------------------------------------------------

With large tables, an alternative to increasing the Word cache is to create
multi-page tables so they appear as a contiguous table; but in reality, they do
not span multiple pages.
