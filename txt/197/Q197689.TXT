TITLE   :PRB: MSDN Causes Error After Installation on External Drives
PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network

KEYWORDS:kbHTMLHelp kbGrpDSTools kbHTMLHelp121

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Launching the MSDN Library and selecting the Index tab throws the following
error:

   IPF in MODULE ITSS.DLL

Or a message box appears with the title:

   Preparing Index For First Use ...

Beneath it you will see a animation displaying a book being written using a pen
continuously. This goes on for a long time without terminating.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because MSDN fails to create Msdn*.chw file in the
%WINDIR%\Help directory. By default, this is Windows\Help for Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows Millennium Edition (Me) systems, and WINNT\Help for
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. This error occurs only when installing MSDN to
an external drive and thus the path information above is valid only for MSDN
files installed on an external drive.

NOTE: The exact name of the CHW file will change with each release of the MSDN
Library. For example the Visual Studio 6.0 edition, the file is named
Msdnvs98.chw. But with the April 1999 MSDN Library, the file is named
Msdn910.chw.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Exit the MSDN Library.

2. Copy the Msdn*.chw file from the MSDN directory on the first CD.

3. Place the file in the %WinDir%\Help directory (see the CAUSE section in this
   article for more details). This error occurs only when installing MSDN to an
   external drive and thus the path information above is only valid for MSDN
   files installed on an external drive.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
