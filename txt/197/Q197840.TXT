SYMPTOMS
========

The backslash ( \ ) and quotation mark ( " ) characters don't display in field
results as you intended.

For example, the field

      {FILLIN "Type "M" or "F" in the box."}

results in the dialog box showing only the word "Type," without the quotation
marks.

CAUSE
=====

The backslash and quotation mark characters are special characters in fields.
The backslash is used to indicate the next character as a switch command in the
field. Quotation marks are used to enclose literal text strings (see below)
within a field.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use a backslash (with no space) before the
character you want to include. This tells Word that you want to include this
character in the text string.

Preface a quotation mark with \ to make it display in a field code.

For example, the field

      {FILLIN "Type \"M\" or \"F\" in the box."}

appears in the dialog box as:

   Type "M" or "F" in the box.

You must also use an extra backslash in an INCLUDE field when you indicate a long
Windows path. For example:

      {INCLUDETEXT "C:\\Winword\\Docs\\Start.doc"}
