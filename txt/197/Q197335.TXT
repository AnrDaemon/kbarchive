TITLE   :XFOR: NOTES Textured Calendar MSG. do not have EndDateTime
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When a user in Exchange Server sends an invitation that lasts for more than one
day to a user in Lotus Notes through the Exchange Notes Connector, the received
notice will show incorrect and incomplete date information. The received message
will not include the end date, and the time will not indicate whether the end
time is for the same day or the following day.

For example, if the StartDateTime = 1998/09/28 9:00, EndDateTime = 1998/10/01
17:00), the textured calendar message would show up as follows:

   CALENDAR ENTRY: INVITATION
   Description:   This is a description
   Date:    1998/09/28
   Time:    09:00 - 17:00 (PST)

Notice that only the Start date shows, and the end date is missing. Also, the end
time does not indicate whether it is in the same day or in the following day.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will happen although all servers in the environment are set to the
same time zone.

WORKAROUND
==========

The problem affects only the "Textured calendar messages but not the SC2 file.
The StartDate and EndDate data in the SC2 file are correct and can be imported
to the Outlook calendar properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
