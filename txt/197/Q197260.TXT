SUMMARY
=======

If you install the Microsoft Natural Language Search feature of Microsoft
Encarta Encyclopedia on a compressed drive, the feature occupies more hard disk
space than is reported by the installation program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the Encarta.nlq file is already compressed on the Encarta CD-ROM, the
compression algorithm used by DriveSpace cannot compress the file much further.
The Encarta.nlq file occupies approximately 37 megabytes (MB) of space on the
physical hard disk which translates into approximately 60 MB of space on the
compressed drive.

Additional query words: multi multi-media media mm enc99 query
