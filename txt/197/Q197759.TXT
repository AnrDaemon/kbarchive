SYMPTOMS
========

Drawing objects that you insert in the main text area of a Word document are
printed over header or footer text, even if you send the drawing object to the
back or behind the text.

CAUSE
=====

By design, the drawing layer in the main text area of the document lies in front
of the drawing layer for the header or footer.

The following diagram demonstrates how Word stacks drawings and text in each
layer:

                 Front Drawing Layer  |-------------------|  / |
                     MAIN TEXT LAYER  |===================| / /|
                  Back Drawing Layer  |-------------------|/ / / 
                                      |                   | / / 
                 Front Drawing Layer  |-------------------|/ / 
   (Header/Footer) BOTTOM TEXT LAYER  |===================| / 
                  Back Drawing Layer  |-------------------|/ 

WORKAROUND
==========

To place a drawing behind the header or footer text, create it in the header or
footer drawing layer and then send it to behind the text.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the diagram earlier in this article, the main text layer of a document and
its drawing layers are in front of objects and text in the bottom
(header/footer) layer of the document. Therefore, if you send a drawing object
to the back in the main text layer, other objects and text in that layer are
printed over this object. However, all the drawing objects in the main text
layer overprint those in the header/footer layer.
