SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Shrink to Fit button on the Print Preview toolbar, Word may
repaginate your document several times. It may appear that Word is repaginating
your document in an endless loop.

CAUSE
=====

Sometimes Word must perform several repagination operations to maximally reduce
the number of pages in a document. If you choose the Shrink to Fit button and
Word is unable to reduce the number of pages in your document after repaginating
the document several times, one of the following messages may appear:

   After several attempts, Word was unable to shrink the document by one page.

-or-

   Word could not shrink the document by one page because the document is
   already one page.

Additional query words: repagination multiple endless loop continuous infinite looping
