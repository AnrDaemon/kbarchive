SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the macro recorder and then try to open a shortcut menu by
clicking the right mouse button, Microsoft Word beeps and nothing happens.

CAUSE
=====

Shortcut menus are context-sensitive, which means that Word determines which
menu to open based on the selection you click with the mouse. While the macro
recorder is running, you cannot use the mouse to move the insertion point or
select text, so, by design, you cannot open a shortcut menu that is based on a
mouse selection.

NOTE: When you record a macro, you can still use the mouse to click menu commands
or to scroll with the scroll bars.
