2. Open the folder for the language you want to install, if necessary.

3. Open the first installation disk folder.

System Requirements:

 - For optimal performance, we recommend Mac OS 8.0 or later. Additionally, on
   the Power Macintosh, we recommend that the virtual memory be set to ON and
   set to a minimum of 1 MB above the installed physical memory.

 - 8 MB of RAM or at least 16 MB of virtual memory is necessary to run Microsoft
   Outlook and Outlook Calendar. You will be able to install only Microsoft
   Outlook if you have 8 MB of RAM.
