TITLE   :XFOR: cc:Mail Dirsync Fails When PO Contain Extended Characters
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WinNT:5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Directory synchronization (dirsync) between Lotus cc:Mail and Exchange Server
will fail with extended characters in the post office (PO) name. For example,
POs with Spanish or French characters in the name will fail at dirsync. Running
dirsync with the Exchange Server computer works correctly when the same PO is
renamed to remove the extended characters.

Error 14005 is reported in the Windows NT Application Event log. The end result
is that no custom recipients are created and dirsync fails.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Connector does not know how to handle extended characters in the
post office name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Rename the post office and remove the extended characters from the post office
name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft acknowledges this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5.
