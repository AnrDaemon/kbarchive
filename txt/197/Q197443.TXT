TITLE   :WD97: Err Message: "Specified Text Is Not a Valid AutoText Name"
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbautotext word97

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you type the name of an AutoText entry and press F3 or click the Insert
AutoText button on the toolbar, Word may beep and display the following message
on the Status Bar:

   The Specified text is not a valid AutoText name. Use Edit AutoText to create
   AutoText entries.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if you don't separate the AutoText entry name from the
preceding or succeeding text with a space.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, type a space before and after the AutoText name
before pressing F3. For example, consider the AutoText entry named "mine":

   mine|all mine   Pressing F3 with the insertion point in this
                   position results in an error.

   mine| all mine  Pressing F3 with the insertion point in this
                   position inserts the AutoText.
