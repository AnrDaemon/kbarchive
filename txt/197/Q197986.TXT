IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article walks through the steps required to configure a Windows 95 client
to receive a system policy in a Windows NT domain environment. Furthermore, it
discusses the additional steps to configure the client computer for load
balancing. Load balancing in this context means that a Windows 95 client can
receive its policy from any validating domain controller. By default, Windows 95
computers will only query the Netlogon share of the primary domain controller
(PDC) for the Config.pol file.

1. Create the policy file from a Windows 95 computer. The System Policy Editor
   application should be installed through Add/Remove Programs. Click the
   Windows Setup tab and click Have Disk. In the Install from Disk dialog box,
   specify the Admin\Apptools\Poledit directory on the Windows 95 compact disc.
   Click OK, and then click OK again. Make sure that System Policy Editor is
   selected. If you want to install group policies on this computer as well,
   click to select the Group Policies check box. Click Install.

2. Ensure that the Windows 95 client's workgroup name is the same as the domain
   name. To verify this, click Start, click Settings, click Control Panel, and
   double-click Network, and then look at the Identification tab.

3. The client must log on to a Windows NT domain. To verify this, click Start,
   click Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click Network. Select
   Client for Microsoft Networks and click properties. Verify that it is
   configured to log on to the correct Windows NT Domain.

4. Enable User Level Access Control. Specify the domain name in the Obtain List
   Of Users And Groups From box. To verify this, click Start, click Settings,
   click Control Panel, and then double-click Network. Click the Access Control
   tab.

5. Make sure User Profiles are enabled on the Window 95 computer. Click Start,
   click Setting, click Control Panel, and double-click Passwords. Click the
   User Profiles tab, click "Users can customize their preferences and desktop
   settings. Windows switches to your personal settings whenever you log in."
   Click to select the appropriate check boxes under User Profile Settings.

6. Restart the computer.

7. On every Windows 95 computer that will needs group policy support, click
   Control Panel, click Add/Remove Programs, click the Windows Setup tab, click
   Have Disk. Use the Poledit folder from Window 95 compact disc. You do NOT
   have to actually install the Policy Editor on each PC, only the Groups
   support.

8. By default, Windows 95 needs to contact the Netlogon share on the PDC to
   check for a Config.pol file. This behavior can be modified by enabling load
   balancing. There are several ways to achieve this behavior:

   a. Enable load balancing in the default computer portion of the policy, which
      will modify the system portion of the registry on the Windows 95 client.
      The client must contact the PDC the first time to apply this policy.
      Subsequent logon requests will download the policy from the validating
      domain controller.

   b. To avoid forcing a Windows 95 client to contact the PDC even one time for
      the policy, you can apply the policy to one computer and then make a
      registry file. Import the exported registry file to each client.

   c. Use Regedit to manually modify the following subkey:

         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Update

      WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that
      may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
      guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry
      Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

      For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
      Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
      Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
      Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit
      it. If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency
      Repair Disk (ERD).

      1. Select the Update key.

      2. On the Edit menu, click New DWORD Value.

      3. Type: LoadBalance.

      4. Double-click the load balance value.

      5. In the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, change the Value Data to 1.
