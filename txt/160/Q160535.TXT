SUMMARY
=======

You might find an entry in the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log that is
similar to the following:

   ID 145
   Category X.400 Service
   Server Name Event Description Occurrence
   RED-82-MSG An error occurred while attempting to route message 1 C=US;A=
   ;P=msft;L=RED-10-MSG-961105030314Z-20600 to alternate recipient
   DN:/o=MICROSOFT/ou=NORTHAMERICA/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=487.The alternate recipient
   is unusable. [MTA DISP:ROUTER 24 119] (14)

The originator of a message set the Recipient Reassignment Prohibited flag in the
message and the recipient had an alternate recipient defined. This reassignment
failed due to the aforementioned flag. This behavior is by product design.

The Recipient Reassignment Prohibited flag is an extended MAPI call and cannot be
set using either the Microsoft Exchange Client or the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program. To set the flag, you must have an application that uses
the extended MAPI call.
