TITLE   :DNS Delegations May Fail
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your Domain Name System (DNS) domain delegations fail and names from the
delegated domains are no longer resolved.

CAUSE
=====

Glue records may disappear.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Glue records are records that allow a DNS to find another DNS that has been
designated as authoritative for a particular domain.

For instance, if you want to delegate authority for the ESS domain in the
MICROSOFT.COM zone to a computer called mydnsserver, you would create the
following records:

    ess      IN NS mydnsserver.ess.microsoft.com.
    mydnsserver.ess.microsoft.com.   IN A  w.x.y.z

where w.x.y.z is the IP address for mydnsserver.

The glue record is the "A" record. Glue records are not technically part of the
zone's authority. Cached data also is not part of a zone's authority. Cached
data eventually expires and gets deleted out of memory. Glue data may also
inadvertently get deleted with the cached data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
