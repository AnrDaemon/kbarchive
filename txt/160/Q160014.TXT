PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::3.5,3.51,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhw kbHardware

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following STOP error message appears on your Windows NT Server:

   STOP: 0x0000007F (0x0000000F, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)

This problem only occurs on single-processor systems with the Intel Pentium Pro
processor.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the local Advanced Program Interrupt Controller (APIC) in the BIOS. Not
all vendors have implemented enabling and disabling of the local APIC as a BIOS
option. If this is the case, contact the system vendor and request an updated
BIOS that corrects Pentium Pro erratum 5AP and 6AP.

NOTE: Not every 7F - F fault in a Pentium Pro single processor system is
necessarily traceable to the APIC.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Faulty hardware was determined to be the cause of this error. The problem was
reported to Intel.
