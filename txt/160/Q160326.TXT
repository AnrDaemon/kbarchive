The following Visual Basic macro finds each table in a Word document

      Sub FindTables()
         Dim iResponse As Integer
         Dim tTable As Table
         'If any tables exist, loop through each table in collection.
         For Each tTable In ActiveDocument.Tables
            tTable.Select
            iResponse = MsgBox("Table found. Find next?", 68)
            If response = vbNo Then Exit For 'User chose to leave search.
         Next
         MsgBox prompt:="Search Complete.", buttons:=vbInformation
      End Sub
