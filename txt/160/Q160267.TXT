-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Lanman Manager 2.1 Client, Lan Manager 2.2 Server, or IBM OS/2 Warp system
attempts to xcopy a file on a Windows NT 4.0 system to itself or location on the
same or another Windows NT 4.0 system, the operation will fail as follows:

   SYS1192: XCOPY cannot access the source or target drive.

CAUSE
=====

The server is incorrectly responding to the Server Message Block (SMB) C
transact2 Query path info, File = <filename>

A network trace will show the following SMB response from the server:

   R transact2 - Server Error, (1) Non-specific error code

The expected response is:

   SMB: R transact2 Open (response)
