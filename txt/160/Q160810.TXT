SUMMARY
=======

The FrontPage Internet Database Connector Wizard allows you to create an

function on some Web servers.

MORE INFORMATION

To use IDC files correctly, you need to publish them to one of the following Web
servers that support the IDC standard:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server
 - Microsoft Peer Web Services for Windows NT 4.0
