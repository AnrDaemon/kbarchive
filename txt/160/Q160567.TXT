TITLE   :SMS: Updating Package Contents Requires Job
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If changes are made to the properties of a package, the message, "Systems
Management Server will update this package at all sites," appears. However, if
changes were made to the package source, these changes are not updated at all
sites.

CAUSE
=====

This message can be construed to mean that any changes to the contents of the
source directory of the package will be updated in both the master copy and on
the master copies on each site. However, no changes to the contents of the
source directory are actually made until a job is sent with the send phase
selecting "even if previously sent." The update to the package refers to the
properties of the package, such as command line changes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To update the contents of a distributed package (for example, to add files to or
update files in a package), modify the source directory as appropriate, create a
new job for the package, and select the "even if previously sent" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
