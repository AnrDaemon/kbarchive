TITLE   :Windows NT Users May Lack Permission to Change Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT 4.0 user may receive the following error message while trying to
change their password when they attempt to log on:

   Change Password
   You do not have permission to change your password.

CAUSE
=====

If both of the following items are selected in User Manager for Domains, the
above error message may be displayed.

For the User Account:
User Must Change Password at Next Logon

For Account Policies:
User must log on in order to change password

MORE INFORMATION
================

For consistency, this behavior has changed from version 3.51, and now is more
similar to a Windows 95 log on attempt. However, unlike other Microsoft clients,
a remote Windows NT computer, which has already logged on, has the ability to
change the password using remote procedure calls. For more information, please
see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
