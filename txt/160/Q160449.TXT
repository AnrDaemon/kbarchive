TITLE   :SNA Client May Incorrectly Connect to Distributed Link Server
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11 SP1,3.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An SNA client may attempt to connect to SNA Server running on a distributed link
server, even though the distributed link server is running in a different SNA
Server subdomain.

There may be no observable problem from the client computer. However, if the
distributed link server can't be reached, the client may experience a long delay
when opening a 3270 or APPC session. This could occur if the client's sponsor
server is connecting through a distributed link.

CAUSE
=====

The SnaBase service supporting a client's sponsor session is incorrectly
advertising the name of the distributed link server to the client computer. This
can cause the client to attempt to connect to the distributed link server when
opening a 3270 or APPC session.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update is available for SNA Server 2.11 SP1 and 3.0. The updated modules are:
Snadmod.dll and Snareg.dll; both are located in <snaroot>\system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 Service
Pack 1 (SP1) and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server version 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
