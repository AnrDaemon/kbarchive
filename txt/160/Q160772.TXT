TITLE   :PRB: "File does not exist" Using FoxTools Functions
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:MACINTOSH:3.0b
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling a function in the Foxtools library generates an Error 1 "Program
<function name> does not exist."

CAUSE
=====

Some FoxTools functions are not compiled with the complete name. For example,
FxNewFolder() needs to be called as FxNewFolde(). To verify how a function
should be called, load the FoxTools library and then look at the output of
DISPLAY STATUS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Drop appropriate letters from the functions name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Load the appropriate version of Foxtools for the Macintosh. Foxtools.cfm is for
PowerPCs only and Foxtools.slm is for both PPC and 68K Macintoshes.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Enter the following commands in the Command window:

         SET LIBRARY TO HOME()+'FoxTools.slm'
         ? FxNewFolder('macintosh hd:test') && Note Error
         ? FxNewFolde('macintosh hd:test')
