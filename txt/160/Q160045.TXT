The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Plus! For Kids includes a text-to-speech component called Talk It!,
which will speak any word that is typed in, phonetically or otherwise, in
several different speaking voices, styles, etc.

Talk It! does not censor any word or combinations of words.

MORE INFORMATION
================

From a technical standpoint, filtering out an obscenity would be difficult
because then homonyms, or words that sound similar to the word in question,
would have to be filtered as well. Combinations of shorter words would also pose
a problem.

Additionally, we do not censor user-generated content. It would be difficult to
generate a global list of what is offensive and what is not.

Additional query words: kids mskids artist maggie max writer cw2 cw2.0 kidsplus kidsplus! pack plus plus!
