TITLE   :FP: New File Name Not Reflected in FrontPage Editor
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you rename a file in FrontPage Explorer while a page with a link to that
file is open in FrontPage Editor, the open page may not reflect the new file
name.

This problem occurs if the link to the renamed file is located in a table cell or
an HTML form.

CAUSE
=====

The code which handles renaming of files in the FrontPage Explorer mistakenly
omitted searching in Tables or Forms for possible links to the renamed item.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Refresh FrontPage Editor after renaming files
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Save all FrontPage Editor changes before you rename files in the FrontPage
   Explorer.

2. In FrontPage Editor, click Refresh on the View menu after you rename a file
   in FrontPage Explorer.

Method 2: Close the affected files before renaming
--------------------------------------------------

In FrontPage Editor, close and save any file with links within a table or HTML
form before you make changes in FrontPage Explorer. When you reopen the file the
updated link information will be accurate.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in FrontPage
98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is most noticeable with images; however, it also affects files
included with the WebBot Include component.

Note that Java Applets are not automatically rebased under any circumstances.
