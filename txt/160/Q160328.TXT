======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 causes Windows NT 4.0 to BLUE screen when you
quit Internet Explorer 3.0 while the Word 95 drawing toolbar is open.


At the time of this article blue screen information was not yet available.

CAUSE
=====

Process objects were being destroyed on the destruction of the IE 3.0 process.
IE 3.0 managed to have the last thread alive on the process which was being used
for process object cleanup (which was a non-GUI thread). This thread handled
menu cleanup but did not clean up GUI objects such as windows properly.

The code has been changed to clean up process objects on Thread cleanup for the
last GUI thread in a process. This ensures that a GUI thread exists for window
cleanup for the menu notification window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
