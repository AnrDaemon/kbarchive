======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a NetWare network administrator has limited the amount of disk space
available to a user in a particular folder on a NetWare server, the free disk
space available reported by the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks does not
reflect this limitation.

The value reported as free disk space is the total amount of space physically
available on the server's volume, instead of the amount available to the user.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks makes a single request for directory
information with the permanent directory handle that returns the total free disk
space.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.
