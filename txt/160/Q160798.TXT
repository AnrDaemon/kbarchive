SUMMARY
=======

It may be desirable for a Systems Management Server administrator to change the
startup type of the Windows NT Remote Control Agent on computers running Windows
NT Server or Workstation to Manual (as opposed to Automatic). To do this, you
need to modify a registry key.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the registry key to change the startup type of the Remote Control
Agent, use the following steps:

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT or Microsoft Systems
Management Server. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from
the use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor.

2. Navigate to the following subkey:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wuser32

3. From the parameter list, select the value that corresponds to your choice.
   Reg_DWord: 0x2 is the default, and it indicates that the startup type is
   Automatic. The following is a list of other startup options:

   0x1 - System
   0x2 - Automatic (default)
   0x3 - Manual
   0x4 - Disabled
