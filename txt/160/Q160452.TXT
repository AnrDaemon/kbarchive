SYMPTOMS
========

If the NVAlert service encounters data for a configured event that exceeds 4 KB
in size, the NVAlert service may stop responding. The following event is logged
when this problem occurs:

   Event ID: 3006
   Source: SNA Netview Alerter
   Type: error
   Description : Error reading log event record.Handle specified is
   <handle>.
   Return Code from ReadEventLog is 122.

CAUSE
=====

The NVAlert service is not properly allocating memory large enough to handle an
alert that exceeds 4 KB.

RESOLUTION
==========

The NVALERT code has been modified to allow any size Event Log entry. If the
current buffer size is not large enough, it is increased to accommodate the
size.


STATUS
======

2.11, 2.11 SP1, and 3.0.
