TITLE   :XCLN: Folder Icon Does Not Change To Briefcase
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a folder created on the Microsoft Exchange Server store for
online and offline synchronization, the folder icon may not change to the
Briefcase icon in the left pane of the Exchange Client. In the right pane, the
icon for the folder to be synchronized appears as the Briefcase, indicating this
folder is set up for online/offline synchronization. This can be confusing
because the left pane does not display the Briefcase icon, and you may think the
folder will not be synchronized, even though the folder has synchronization
enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either move, copy, or delete a message to the
folder where synchronization is enabled, or exit and re-start the Exchange
Client. Performing any of these steps causes the folder icon to update to the
Briefcase icon. At this point, the left and right panes will both show the
correct Briefcase icon for the folder to be synchronized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in of Microsoft Exchange Client
version 4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
