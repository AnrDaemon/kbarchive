IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt.32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

A noticeable delay occurs when the logged on user or an administrator attempts
to unlock a workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 will update the domain list if the cached list's age exceeds two
minutes (by default). This feature is beneficial to users from a newly trusted
domain who need to log on to workstations or servers that have been locked by a
previous user.

Adjusting the following registry entry allows modification to the time period in
which the domain list becomes out-of-date. The valid range for this entry is 2
minutes (default) to 1 day, specified in the number of seconds. Note that
modifying this value could result in users not seeing the current domain list.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To modify this value, perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), modify (or create if necessary) the
   following:

   Hive:   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   Key:    Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
   Value:  DcacheMinInterval
   Type:   REG_DWORD
   Data:   120-86400 (decimal)(expressed in seconds)

2. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer for these changes to take
   effect.
