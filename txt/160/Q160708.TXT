The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run Scanpst.exe against a personal folder file (.pst) it may return
incorrect values for "folders found in this file" or "Items found in this file."
As a result, you may believe mail exists in your pst that you cannot access
through the Microsoft Exchange client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If folders and\or individual mail messages are moved from the pst file to the
server (mailbox) by means of a drag-and-drop operation, Scanpst shows the values
for "folders found in this file" or "Items found in this file" as the values
prior to moving the messages/folders.

Note : If the messages are deleted from a pst or moved to another pst, the values
are correctly reported by Scanpst.
