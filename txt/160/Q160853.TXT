TITLE   :SMS: Mandatory Jobs Will Be Blocked If Details Window Is Open
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusage kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a user has the Job Details window open for any job, the processing of a
mandatory job will be blocked after it has arrived at the desktop, until the Job
Details window is closed.

CAUSE
=====

When the Job Details window is open, it obtains ownership of the Package Command
Manager (PCM) thread. Until the ownership is released, PCM has no way of forcing
a mandatory job to run.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, close the Job Details window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
