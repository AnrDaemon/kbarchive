SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to add the Read Receipt MAPI property that is
associated with each message to a Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client Folder
view.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To add the Read Receipt MAPI property:

1. Cut and paste the .cfg portion of this document (see text below) into an
   ASCII text editor and save the file to your Windows\Forms\Configs directory
   as Mesnote2.cfg.

2. From the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client, install the .cfg file using
   the Forms Manager. On the Tools menu, click Options; on the Microsoft
   Exchange Server page, click the Manage Forms button. Click Set to designate
   the folder to be customized (typically the Inbox). Click Install and locate
   the Mesnote2.cfg file. Install the Mesnote2.cfg file, and then close all
   dialog boxes.

3. From the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client, create the view. To do this,
   click View, click Define Views, and click New View. Call the new view
   Current+. Click Columns and add RRR from the available columns list.

You should now have a view that will tell you who is sending messages with read
request notification.

You can use this property now to set rules and sort messages in folders.
Ultimately, many MAPI properties can be exposed this way. The following is an
example of exposing one such property.
