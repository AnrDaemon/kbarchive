SUMMARY
=======

The packet burst protocol is built on top of Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)
and can speed the transfer of multiple packet NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) file
reads and writes. Packet bursting speeds the transfer of NCP data between a
workstation and a NetWare server by eliminating the need to sequence and
acknowledge each packet. In other words, the server or workstation can send a
whole set (burst) of packets before requiring an acknowledgment.

Although IPX does not require one-request, one-response type communication, the
normal NCP implementation usually does. Burst mode communicates using a
multipacket which includes the IPX headers for each packet, the burst headers
for each packet and the request or reply, with or without data.

The packets that make up the burst are called fragments. One burst can be up to
64 KB in length. By allowing multiple packets to be acknowledged, the burst
protocol can reduce network traffic on most IPX networks.

Additionally, the packet burst protocol monitors dropped packets and retransmits
only the missing packets.

Packet Bursting in Windows NT
-----------------------------

Windows NT 3.51 and Windows NT 4.0 have packet bursting enabled automatically and
will not need any additional configuring to use packet bursting for Gateway
Services for NetWare (GSNW) or Microsoft Client Service for NetWare (CSNW)
connectivity to a NetWare server.

To disable Packet bursting in Windows NT 3.51 or Windows NT 4.0 use Registry
Editor to do the following:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWCWorkstation\Parameters

2. On the Edit menu, click Add value, and add a parameter value called
   MaxBurstSize with a type of REG_DWORD and set the value to 0 (zero).

3. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer for the above settings to take
   effect.
