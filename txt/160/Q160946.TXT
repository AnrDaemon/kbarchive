TITLE   :Setup Hangs During First Reboot with Compaq NetFlex Driver
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:osr2 win95

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) Setup on a computer with a
Compaq NetFlex controller (network adapter), the computer may stop responding
(hang) on the first reboot. When you restart the computer, Setup does not
continue and the computer may hang again.

CAUSE
=====

The Compaq NetFlex driver supplies only a 4K buffer when paging in real mode,
such as during the first reboot during Setup or when it is running in MS-DOS
Compatibility mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

 - Contact your hardware vendor to obtain the Windows 95 OEM Service Release
   version 2.1 update.

 - Remove the NetFlex card from your computer and run Setup again. Do not choose
   Safe Recovery when you are prompted. When OSR2 is installed, put the card
   back in your computer and use the Add New Hardware tool in Control Panel to
   detect it.

   NOTE: If your hard disk is using MS-DOS Compatibility mode, your computer may
   hang when you run the Add New Hardware tool.

   For information about troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility mode, see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
