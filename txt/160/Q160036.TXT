======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release version 2 or 2.1
and you are using either the Windows 95 Client for NetWare Networks or the
Novell 32-bit client for Windows 95, the %OS_VERSION variable returns "V7.00"
rather than the value "V7.10" as you expect.

CAUSE
=====

Nwredir.vxd returns an incorrect version.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

You can resolve this issue by adding the version information for Nwredir.vxd to
the registry. Use Registry Editor to add a ShellVersion binary value to the
following registry key:

   HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\NWREDIR

Add the following value to the new value:

   4d 53 44 4f 53 00 56 37 2e 31 30 00 49 42 4d 5f 50 43 00 49 42 4d 00

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
