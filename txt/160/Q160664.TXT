TITLE   :XFOR: Cannot Configure Microsoft Mail Connector (AppleTalk)
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbenv kbui

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Mail Connector (AppleTalk) and you attempt to
configure the gateway, you may be unable to do so. In the AppleTalk Mail client,
on the Mail menu, if you point to Gateway, and then click Configuration, a
Gateway Configuration dialog box with an Install button appears, but the entire
dialog box is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you use Connection Installer to create a gateway with
a gateway ID that contains lowercase letters.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, create a new gateway with a gateway ID that does
not contain lowercase letters.
