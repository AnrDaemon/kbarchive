TITLE   :SMS: Delete Special Doesn't Remove Entries from Machine Groups
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbusage kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsgeneral kbArtTypeINF

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A delete special based on "Machines with last activity" from the Sites window
will remove inactive computers from the Sites window, but will not remove any
static Machine groups that included those computers. In their place, there will
be a blank line with a machine icon at the beginning.

In Systems Management Server, version 1.1 only, this can result in an Dr. Watson
error if a package is dropped on a machine group where old deleted machines
remain. For example:

An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
generated.

   SMSEXEC.exe
   Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), address 0x1f0f1dd4

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

 - Manually delete the inactive computer from the machine group.

-or-

 - Manually delete the computer from the Sites window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
