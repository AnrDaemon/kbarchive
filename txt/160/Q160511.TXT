TITLE   :Regsec.exe Gives Strange Results for Non-Administrator
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0 Resource Kit now includes a utility
called Regsec.exe. This utility removes the Everyone group from the root of the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
registry hives. No online Help is available from the command line and typing
"/?" from the command line carries out the changes of the permissions on the
registry. Carrying out this command changes behavior for all users who logon
locally (other than the Administrators group). Power Users are affected for
computers running Windows NT Workstation. On computers running Windows NT
Server, Account Operators, Server Operators, Print Operators, and all other
non-Administrator accounts are affected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Resource Kit Help file states:

This command-line utility removes the Everyone group from a registry key.
Removing the Everyone group can enable you to implement stricter and more
specific security.

Some of the symptoms include desktop icons becoming plain yellow file folders,
and not being able to double click on "My Computer" and other icons. If Windows
NT Explorer is launched, all the file icons are the default Windows icon.

Remote network connections are not affected.

Normal behavior can be returned by adding the group Everyone to the root of each
hive listed above with READ access.
