TITLE   :FP: Frames Wizard Doesn't Confirm Completion
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER:windows:1.1,97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage for Windows 1.1 
 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the FrontPage Frames wizard is finished, it returns to FrontPage Editor
without indicating that the steps in the wizard have been completed
successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you use a template, the wizard will create the frameset page and all
corresponding pages for the frame document. If you make a custom grid without
specifying the location of the component pages, the frameset page is created
with broken links to the component pages. Creating pages in the location
referred to by the frame set will correct the broken links.
