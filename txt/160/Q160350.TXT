TITLE   :Index Server Returns HTTP 500 Error
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Index Server version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Index Server processes one query, and then the following error message
appears:

   HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (The security descriptor structure is invalid.)

CAUSE
=====

Setup incorrectly registers the idq ISAPI extension with a partial path.
Internet Information Server requires all extensions be registered with a full
path. When another service or ISAPI extension changes directory, it may cause
Index Server to return error 500.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Index Server 2.0 or Windows 2000 Indexing
Service.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you need to edit the registry:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

      System/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3SVC/Parameters/Script Map

3. Change the value for .ida from "idq.dll" to the following

      <Systemroot>\system32\idq.dll

   where Systemroot is the system directory for Windows NT (the value of the
   %Systemroot% environment variable).

4. Change the value for .idq to be the same as for .ida.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Microsoft Index Server version
1.0. This problem has been corrected in Index Server 2.0 and Windows 2000
Indexing Service.
