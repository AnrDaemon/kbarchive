TITLE   :FP97: Memory Leak in FP Extensions on MS Personal Web Server
PRODUCT :Word Front Page
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

FrontPage 97 and the Microsoft Personal Web Server may cause memory to become
fragmented when you do the actions listed in the following table.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| When you do this                                                                                                    | This Amount of Memory Is Fragmented | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In FrontPage Explorer click Refresh on the View menu                                                                | 30K per transaction                 | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| In FrontPage Editor click Save on the File menu (and you then save
the file to a Microsoft Personal Web Server Web) | 5K-8K per transaction               | 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: The information in this table was gathered from tests that used repetitive
operations with identical data. Actual usage will probably cause less memory
leakage, because the changing data will rescue some of the stranded data from
the fragmented memory heap. Note also that these operations do not fragment
memory in Windows NT, nor do they fragment memory with the FrontPage Personal
Web Server or O'Reilly & Associate's WebSite, or Netscape Corporation's
FastTrack 2.0 on Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid performance degradation with the FrontPage Server Extensions on the
Microsoft Personal Web Server, restart it occasionally whenever your system
seems to be slow or low on memory.

The Microsoft Personal Web Server is designed as a Personal Web Server only, and
is not intended for high traffic Web sites. If you have a high traffic Web site,
you should upgrade to Windows NT Server and the Microsoft Internet Information
Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A heavily used Microsoft Personal Web Server on Windows 95 may eventually
develop performance problems. A computer with limited hard disk drive space will
be more susceptible to these problems, because it will run out of swap space
sooner. If you are using disk-based Webs and your system becomes slow or memory
becomes low, restart FrontPage Explorer (FrontPage Explorer using a disk-based
Web is subject to the same fragmentation as the Microsoft Personal Web Server).

NOTE: When the memory heap gets highly fragmented, the server process tends to
slow down (due to increased paging activity, and heap operations take longer
because the heap data structures are larger).

independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
