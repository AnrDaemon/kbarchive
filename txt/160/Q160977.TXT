generate the following error message:

   If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details (on Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition, press ALT+D),
you receive the following message:

NOTE: The actual memory address may vary.

Help menu, click the Index tab in Microsoft Word Help, type the following text

   seq

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Seq (Sequence) field"
topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office
