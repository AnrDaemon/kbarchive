TITLE   :DNS Zone Transfer Fails After WINS Record Added
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have added Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) resource records to your
Domain Name System (DNS). Now, zone transfers fail between Windows NT 4.0
servers. The following error is displayed:

   ID 1601 Source: DNS Warning: DNS Server encountered bad packet from <IP of
   Primary>. Processing leads beyond packet length.

CAUSE
=====

WINS resource record lengths are miscalculated.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a temporary workaround, you can stop and start the DNS service on the
primary. The zone transfer should take place after restarting the service.

A permanent fix for this problem is included in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 or
later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
