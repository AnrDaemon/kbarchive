KEYWORDS:kbusage kbdta

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft FrontPage 97 for Windows with Bonus Pack 
 - Microsoft FrontPage for the Macintosh, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Properties dialog box for an ActiveX object, the Alignment box does not
include the Center option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, select the Middle option.

"Middle" has the same effect as "Center" when you view the page in a Web browser.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft FrontPage
98 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Align="Center" parameter of the <Object> tag does not center the
object horizontally. It only centers surrounding text vertically alongside the
object.

If you want to center an object horizontally, use either of the following
methods.

Method 1
--------

Select the object and click Paragraph on the Format menu. In the Paragraph
Alignment list, select Center, and then Click OK.

Method 2
--------

Select the object and click the Center button on the Standard toolbar.
