PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbdta kbvirus kbtemplate word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The macro warning message does not appear when you attempt to open a document or
template that contains macros.

CAUSE
=====

By design, when you open a document or template that is located in the user
templates or workgroup templates folder, the macro warning message is not
displayed.

Microsoft Word considers documents and templates that are stored in either the
user templates or workgroup templates folder to be "trustworthy" or free of
unwanted macro viruses.

NOTE: Do not place documents or templates in the user or workgroup templates
folder unless you are absolutely certain that they are free of macro virus code.
You should scan your documents and templates regularly using a third-party virus
detection program that is capable of detecting Word macro viruses. For
additional information about third-party virus protection programs, click the

To determine where Word is storing your templates, click Options on the Tools
menu, and then click the File Locations tab.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the document or template you are opening contains macros, the following
warning appears:

   The document you are opening contains macros or customizations. Some macros
   may contain viruses that could harm your computer.

If you are sure this document is from a trusted source, click Enable Macros. If
you are not sure and want to prevent any macros from running, click Disable
Macros.

Macro virus protection is turned on by default when you install Word. If you have
disabled this warning message, you can reset it using the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the General tab.

2. Click to select the Macro Virus Protection check box, and then click OK.
