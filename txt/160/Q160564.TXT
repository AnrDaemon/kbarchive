TITLE   :XFOR: MSMail Read-Receipts Missing Data Across Organizations
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0,5.0,5.5
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage exc5 exc55

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a mail message from a Microsoft Mail 3.x client to a Microsoft
Exchange user in a different organization with a read-receipt request, the
result is a read-receipt returned that is missing the To and Subject fields.

Also, mail sent from Microsoft Exchange to a Microsoft Mail user across a
different organization with a read-receipt request will result in the following
returned receipt:

   Your message

      To:   Unknown
      Subject: Unknown
      Sent: Unknown

   was read on 11/8/96 8:36:00 AM.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Mail client generates and responds to Read Receipts using MAPI
commands. These commands are encapsulated by Exchange in the MDBEF format when
they arrive in Exchange. However, when going to another Exchange organization,
they are converted to a native X.400 format, and the MDBEF properties are
stripped out.

The Microsoft Mail client cannot compensate for this X.400 limitation, because it
does not know how to properly encode the message using standard X.400 flags for
the handling of read receipts.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only current workaround for this Microsoft Mail client limitation is to
include all of the computers in the same organization running Microsoft Exchange
Server so that the MDBEF can be preserved and the read receipt will maintain its
proper format.
