MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 4.0 may also not install on a computer with 4 GB of RAM installed. A
STOP 0x0000003f may occur during installation. To resolve this issue, use the
following methods:

 - Remove 2 GB of the physical RAM, install Windows NT, apply SP3, and then
   reinstall the physical RAM.

 - If the STOP 0x0000003f occurs during the GUI-mode portion of Setup, the
   installation can be halted immediately prior to the GUI mode portion and the
   /maxmem switch can be used in the Boot.ini file. For additional information
   about this switch, please see the following article in the Microsoft
   Knowledge Base:
