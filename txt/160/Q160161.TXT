TITLE   :FIX: SPACE BAR+ARROW KEY Causes GPF When Unloading Form
PRODUCT :Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSVB

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With a form that contains at least two controls that are capable of receiving
focus, if the SPACE BAR+ARROW KEY combination is pressed while the focus is on
the control whose click event contains the code "Unload Me," a General
Protection Fault (GPF) will occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Instead of unloading the form immediately in the click event of a control, place
a Timer control on the form and use it to defer this action for one millisecond
using the following code:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
          '''Unload Me
          Timer1.Interval = 1
      End Sub

      Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
          Unload Me
      End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Basic 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place two CommandButtons, Command1 and Command2, on Form1.

3. Place the following code in the Command1_Click event:

      Private Sub Command1_Click()
          Unload Me
      End Sub

4. Run the project by pressing the F5 key.

5. With the focus on Command1, press the SPACE BAR+ARROW KEY combination and
   note that a GFP occurs.
