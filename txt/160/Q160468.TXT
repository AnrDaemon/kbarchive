PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Kids Products
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you print graphics from within Creative Writer 2 to a Canon Bubble Jet
printer, graphics may print as a solid black box with the color graphic overlaid
on top or as solid black silhouettes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work around this issue, change the printer driver to another printer
emulation, such as the Epson LQ2550 for the Canon Bubble Jet 4000C, the Canon
Bubble Jet 620C, or the IBM ProPrinter X24E for the Canon Bubble Jet 210.

Check printer documentation for more information regarding printer emulation
drivers. This appears to be a problem with the Canon drivers.

To change the printer driver:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the Add Printer icon.

3. Follow the Add Printer Wizard to add the appropriate printer emulation
   driver. Be sure to set the new emulation driver as your default printer.

4. Click Finish.

When you print graphics from Creative Writer 2 with the emulation printer driver
(for example Epson LQ2550), graphics should print correctly.

For more information regarding Canon BJC printer drivers and updates, contact
Canon Technical Support at (800) 423-2366.
