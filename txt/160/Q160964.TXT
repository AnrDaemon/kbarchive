TITLE   :0x0000001e When Printing Certain Documents from Windows NT 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a document that contains a 1 point font from any application, the
Windows NT print server crashes unexpectedly with the following Blue Screen
error:

   STOP: 0x0000001e (0xc0000094, 0xfe7533ca, 0xc0000094, 0x00000010)
   Kmode_Exception_Not_Handled. RASDD.DLL

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT cannot despool a job that contains a font of a single point. This
causes a divide by zero and forces Windows NT to have a blue screen error when
trying to print. Prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2, the spooler was
configured to always respool a pending job during startup time, If the job in
the spooler is damaged or contains a 1 point font, it can cause the computer to
display a blue screen error continually.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem, delete the *.spl and *.shd files from the following
directory:

   %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\PRINTERS

NOTE: If you are using a FAT file system, you can start the server using MS- DOS
or a bootable floppy and remove the files mentioned above. If the Windows NT
directory (or Spool file location) resides on an NTFS volume, it will be
necessary to install a parallel installation and remove the files using File
Manager or Explorer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0 For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
