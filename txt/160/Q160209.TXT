TITLE   :XCLN: Quiet Mode Setup (setup /q) Defaults to Pacific Time
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running quiet mode Setup (setup /q), with the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client (16-bit client), the Time Zone defaults to Pacific Time in Microsoft
Exchange (and Schedule+). There is no stf entry to modify this behavior.

CAUSE
=====

On a Win16 platform (Windows 3.1x and Windows for Workgroups 3.1x), Time Zone
information is stored in the [MAPI 1.0 TimeZone] section of the Win.ini file. If
this section is not present when quiet mode Setup is run, Pacific Time is
selected during Setup.

Note this is not a problem under Windows 95 or Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

 - Prior to running quiet mode Setup with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x
   client, add the appropriate entries to the [MAPI 1.0 TimeZone] section of the
   Win.ini file. If these entries are present prior to running quiet mode Setup
   (setup /q), they will be maintained.

The following (including the header) are examples of entries that would need to
be added to the Win.ini prior to running the Microsoft Exchange quiet mode
Setup.
