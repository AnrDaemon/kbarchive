TITLE   :Ntregmon.exe causes STOP 0x0000001E with New Service Pack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the latest Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack, running the
utility Ntregmon.exe 1.1 will cause Windows NT to crashdump with a STOP
0x0000001E error in the driver Regsys.sys.

CAUSE
=====

The Regsys.sys device driver that comes with NTREGMON directly accesses data
structures internal to Windows NT. This type of access to the data structures is
illegal. Anytime there is an update to Windows NT there is a possibility that
these internal data structures will change. These changes result in the driver
creating or utilizing invalid pointers and causing the crashdump.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NTREGMON is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
