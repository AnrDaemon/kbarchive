SYMPTOMS
========

When using HC31.exe to compile a Help project, the .hpj file is assumed to be
using OEM character sets (MS-DOS code, page 850 or 437). If the title specified
in the .hpj file contains characters with values higher than 127, and the .hpj
file is modified using a Windows editor such as Notepad, those characters can
appear to be wrong when the Help file is run.

CAUSE
=====

In an .hpj file, under the [OPTIONS] section, the title is specified as:

   "TITLE=Help Example that contains [ASCII 224]"

The "[ASCII 224]" character was entered using Notepad, holding down the ALT key,
and typing "0224" (without the quotation marks) on the numeric keypad. When the
Help file is run after being compiled using HC31.exe, you see that the Help
window title reads:

   "Help Example that contains [ASCII 211]"

This problem occurs because of the difference between the OEM code page (850) and
the ANSI code page (1252). Value 224 is the character '[ASCII 211]' under code
page 850, but it is the character '[ASCII 224]' under code page 1252. Because
the .hpj file is assumed to be using code page 850, '[ASCII 211]' is put on the
title when HC31 is processing the Help project.

RESOLUTION
==========

If your .hpj file contains characters with values higher than 127, use an MS-DOS
editor, such as Edit, to write your .hpj file.
