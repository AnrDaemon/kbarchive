TITLE   :PPT7: Invisible Shapes Print With Borders in Black and White
PRODUCT :Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:7.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print an object whose color is the same as the slide background color
to a black and white printer, it is printed with a border anyway.

CAUSE
=====

By default, PowerPoint prints a drawing object with a border when you print to a
black and white printer.

You can configure every object on your slide to be printed based on the type of
printer you are using. This feature is useful if your slide contains a dark or
gradient background and you want to print it without using up too much ink or
toner.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the way an object is printed to a black and white printer, use either
of the following methods.

Method 1: Turn Off the Black & White Print Option
-------------------------------------------------

Using this method, your slide prints as a gray-scale representation of the color
version you see on the screen. With many presentations, this may be the effect
you want.

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Click to clear the Black & White check box.

3. Select any other printing options you want and click OK.

Method 2: Customize the Black and White View
--------------------------------------------

1. On the View menu, click Black And White.

   Your presentation now appears the way it will print with the Black & White
   printing option enabled.

2. Switch to the slide that contains the shape you want to print without a
   border.

3. Right-click the object, point to Black And White on the menu that appears,
   and then click White.

You may want to experiment with the other Black and White options to figure out
which effect you like the best.

NOTE: You can use this method any time an object is printed differently to a
black and white printer than it appears on your screen.
