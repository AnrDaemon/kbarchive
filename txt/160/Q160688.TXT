The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Monster Truck Madness, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the retail version of Monster Truck Madness, the computer may stop
responding (hang) or the video may not display correctly. However, the demo
version does not exhibit this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

The video card does not support Hardware Acceleration.

To resolve the issue, try one of the following:

Turn Off Hardware Acceleration in Monster Truck Madness
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Monster Truck Madness without the compact disc in the drive.

   NOTE: This will NOT work if Monster Truck Madness was installed using the
   Compact option.

2. On the Options menu, click Graphics, and clear the Use Hardware Acceleration
   check box.

Turn Off Hardware Acceleration in Windows
-----------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics in the Advanced Settings
   section.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider to the None setting (all the way to the
   left), and then click OK.

5. In the System Properties box, click OK.

Update Your Video Driver with a DirectX Compatible Driver
---------------------------------------------------------

First, contact your video card manufacturer and follow the manufacturer's
instructions to get the latest driver. Typically this will be a PKZip file, or a
self-extracting executable file.

If the manufacturer of your video card includes specific instructions for
installing the driver, follow them. Otherwise, unzip the files into a temporary
folder on your hard disk, or onto a floppy disk. Then follow the instructions
below:

1. Open the Display Properties dialog box by using your right mouse button to
   click the Desktop and then click Properties from the popup menu.

2. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Settings tab.

3. Click Change Display Type.

4. In the Advanced Display Properties dialog box, click the Adapter tab.

5. Click Change.

6. In the Select Device dialog box, click Have Disk.

7. If you have the latest video driver from your video card manufacturer on a
   disk or compact disc, select the appropriate drive and click OK. Otherwise
   click Browse and from the temporary folder you created for your video card
   manufacturer's files, and open the file called Display.inf.

8. In the Select Device dialog box, choose the driver that matches your video
   card and then click OK.

9. Click OK as many times as necessary to accept the changes.

10. Click Yes in the System Settings Change dialog box to restart your computer.
