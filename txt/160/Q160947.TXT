======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send an X.400 message with an O/R address that has a null
Domain Defined Attributes (DDA) type or DDA value, you may receive a
non-delivery report (NDR) that contains the text "content-type-not- supported."
In addition, an event similar to the following may appear in the event log:

   Source: MSExchangeMTA
   Event: 290
   Description: A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and
   diagnostic code content-type-not-supported) is being generated for message
   <address>. It was originally destined for <address>;
   <recipient>, and was to be redirected to. [MTA DISP:RESULT 16 136] (12)

where <address> is the O/R address and <recipient> is the first
recipient on the message.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server does not support null O/R address fields.


RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the X.400 message so that the DDA type and DDA value are not null. The
maximum value for the DDA type is 8 and the maximum value for the DDA value is
128.
