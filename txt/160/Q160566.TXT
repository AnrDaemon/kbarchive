TITLE   :SMS: PCM Command Line and "Cannot Find File" Error
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage kbPCM smspcm

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager (PCM) attempts to run a command, and the command
line points to a specific drive letter (for example, Q:\App1), a dialog box
appears with the following error message:

   Cannot find the file <filename>. Make sure that the file exists on your
   system and that the path and filename are correct.

CAUSE
=====

Package Command Manager is looking for the file in the package, not in the
specified location.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, place the file referred to in the command line in
the package. Do not specify a path in the command line properties of the
package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
