TITLE   :WD97: Macro Name Truncated in Customize Dialog Box
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmacro word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the Commands list in the Customize dialog box, the right-most
characters in the command or macro names are truncated.

NOTE: When you select a Word command instead of a macro, you can click the
Description button to view the full command name. This option is not available
when you select a macro.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the command name or macro name that you select is so
long that it is not fully visible in the Commands list.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word appends additional information to the macro name to better define
the macro. For example, Word might append a macro called "InsertMergeFields"
with "Normal.NewMacros." so that when it appears in the Commands list it
resembles the following:

   Normal.NewMacros.InsertMergeFields

Or, Word might append a macro called "DoubleSpacingMacro" with
"TemplateProject.NewMacros." so that when it appears in the Commands list it
resembles the following:

   TemplateProject.NewMacros.DoubleSpacingMacro

The full macro name appears when you add the macro to a menu or a toolbar button.
