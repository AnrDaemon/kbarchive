SYMPTOMS
========

The following message is displayed when logging on to a domain using a
non-Administrative account from a workstation.

Windows NT
----------

   Your account is configured to prevent you from logging on and using this
   workstation. Please try another workstation.

Other clients
-------------

   The user is not allowed to log on from this workstation.

Depending on the client, the associated network message number, 2240, may also be
included with the above message.

CAUSE
=====

This message will be displayed if the user account is configured to log on from
specific workstations. To set this option, select User Properties and click the
"Logon To" button.

This message will also be displayed if the Windows NT Resource Kit utility, C2
Configuration Manager (C2Config.exe) has been run on the validating server and
the "Halt on Audit Failure" security feature is enabled.

When the Security Log size reaches capacity, only Administrators will be able to
access the server.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, an Administrator should clear the Security Log and run
C2CONFIG to reset the CrashOnAuditFail value.
