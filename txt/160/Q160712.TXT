SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a multimedia program that uses CD Audio, such as Magic School Bus
Explores the Earth, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

   CdAudio Error 26 MMsystem282

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if you have specified the wrong CD-ROM drive in the CD
Music section of the Multimedia settings in Control Panel.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Multimedia.

3. Click the CD Music tab.

4. In the CD-ROM Drive box, enter the appropriate drive letter, and click OK.

5. Start the program.

At this point the CD Audio error should not appear, and CD Audio should play
correctly from the program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The symptoms described above may occur if a CD-ROM changer (multiple CD-ROM
drive) is being used on the computer, where each drive is assigned a different
drive letter. Because Windows assigns a specific drive letter to be used for
playing audio compact discs, this problem may occur.
