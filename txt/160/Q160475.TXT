The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Clip Gallery for Windows 95, version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Publisher 97 
 - Microsoft PowerPoint 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you download a clip from the Design Gallery Live site on the World Wide Web,
it is downloaded as a .cil (Clip Gallery Package) file. This article explains
how to use these files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have Internet access, you can connect to a special site on the World Wide
Web directly from Microsoft Clip Gallery. This site contains additional clip art
that you can download.

Here's what happens when you select a piece of clip art to download:

 - Your Web browser copies a file to your Internet cache directory. This file
   has a .cil extension.

 - Your Web browser runs the .cil file. This expands the clip art file and
   copies it to the following folder:

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry\Downloaded Clips

 - Clip Gallery registers the new clip and adds the information about the clip
   to your primary .cag file.

NOTE: If you have Microsoft Clip Gallery, you can run a .cil file by
double-clicking it in Windows Explorer. If you think you have downloaded a new
clip but cannot find it in Clip Gallery, search for files with a .cil extension,
and then run the appropriate file by double-clicking it.
