SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install Windows 95 using a PCI network adapter and
an Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

When you are installing Windows 95 over the network using a PCI network adapter,
the network adapter is not recognized until after the first reboot. Therefore,
you have no network connectivity to finish copying all the necessary drivers.
However, using an Msbatch.inf file, you can specify the network adapter on the
"netcards=" line in the [Network] section of the file. When you do this, all of
the necessary drivers are copied at the first reboot, but you receive the
following error message:

   Windows Networking
   Your network adapter <network adapter name> is not working properly.
   You may need to set it up again. For more information, see the Network
   Troubleshooter in Windows Help.

When you click OK, Setup proceeds normally. This occurs because the driver is
installed, but the PCI bus has not been enumerated. Once the bus has been
enumerated, the adapter functions correctly and this error message does not
occur.

This error message can interrupt an automated network installation. To work
around this error message, follow these steps:

In the Msbatch.inf file, modify the [Install] section to include the following
line:

   AddReg=pcinic.reg

Also, add the following section and key to the Msbatch.inf file:

   [pcinic.reg]
   HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0000,
   "DisableWarning",,"1"

   NOTE: This line should be typed as a single line. It has been wrapped
   in this article for readability purposes.

   NOTE: For multiple adapters, multiple registry entries may be needed in
   the Msbatch.inf file. For example two network adapters may require the
   following section and keys:

      [pcinic.reg]
      HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0000,
      "DisableWarning",,"1"
      HKLM,\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Class\Net\0001,
      "DisableWarning",,"1"

NOTE: If you are installing Dial-Up Networking, this procedure is not needed
because the error message does not occur.
