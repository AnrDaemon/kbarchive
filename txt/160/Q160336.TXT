TITLE   :Shortcut to Frame in a Show May Not Work Correctly
PRODUCT :The Microsoft Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.5,95
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbmsn

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a shortcut that you created to a frame in a show on MSN, The
Microsoft Network, the shortcut may open Microsoft Internet Explorer instead of
Program Viewer. You may see the information to which you created the shortcut,
but the information may not be formatted correctly. You may also receive a
VBScript Runtime error message.

CAUSE
=====

When you use the right mouse button to click in a frame and create a shortcut,
you are pointing at a subframe. This means that when you use the shortcut, it
loads from that subframe and may not load everything needed to correctly display
the information.

Additional query words: msn
