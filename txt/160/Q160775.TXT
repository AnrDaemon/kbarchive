TITLE   :SMS: Job Status Not Updated for NetWare Clients
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPCM smspcmkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server detailed job status information for MS-DOS and
Windows 3.1 NetWare clients is not updated after the completion of the job. This
problem typically affects clients running Novell's NETX redirector.

CAUSE
=====

Package Command Manager for DOS (PCMDOS) and Windows (PCMWIN16) fails to write
the job status information to the logon server's Despooler.box directory after
job completion. Both PCMDOS and PCMWIN16 rely upon writing job status
information (for example, job success or failure) to the following UNC path:
\\Logonserver\SMS\Logon.srv\Despoolr.box. UNC paths are not supported correctly
using the NETX redirector. Novell VLM clients appear to be unaffected when a UNC
path is used from a network drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
