SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the mouse driver in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Control Panel Mouse has a General tab that shows the mouse type. The Name box
shows the mouse type in use, and there is also a Change button. When you click
Change, you can select another mouse driver or load a third-party driver by
clicking Have Disk.

Note that the Name box on the General tab does not show the specific name of your
mouse; rather, it shows the name of the type of mouse family whose driver is
currently installed on the system.

Windows NT supports Microsoft and Logitech compatible pointing devices. Devices
that do not meet these specifications may require a third-party driver.
