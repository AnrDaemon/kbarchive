TITLE   :Sharing Violation When Accessing User Profiles
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A sharing violation may result from users logging on simultaneously and
accessing a roaming mandatory or personal profile at exactly the same time.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows NT 4.0 reads the time and date stamp of the profile, the file is
opened in exclusive mode rather than allowing it to be shared. Because the file
is opened in exclusive mode, another user who attemps to open the same profile
will fail because the file cannot be accessed while opened by the first user.

RESOLUTION
==========

When a roaming profile is accessed from a computer running Windows NT 4.0
Workstation with the latest service pack applied, it is opened with shared
access, allowing multiple users to retrieve the time and date stamp, as well as
read the file for the copy process to the local workstation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest US Service Pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
