SYMPTOMS
========

When you add a stock Text or Caption property to an MFC ActiveX control that
subclasses a Combo or List Box, it will not serialize properly.

CAUSE
=====

When a container attempts to read the Text or Caption property for an MFC
ActiveX control, the MFC framework calls COleControl::GetText. GetText calls
COleControl::InternalGetText. InternalGetText may attempt to get the Text or
Caption property from the control with the following call:

      if (DefWindowProc(WM_GETTEXT, (WPARAM)_cchUsual,
          (LPARAM)m_strText.GetBufferSetLength(_cchUsual)) >= _cchUsual - 1)

In the case of subclassed Combo or List Box control, this call will always return
an empty buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

It is debatable whether it makes sense to have a Text or Caption property for a
subclassed Combo or List Box. The native Combo and List Box controls do not
respond to the WM_SETTEXT or WM_GETTEXT messages. Therefore, the problem
described above occurs.

If it makes sense to do this in your application, it is easy to make this work:
When adding the Text or Caption property to the ActiveX control, simply select
the stock property and select Get / Set methods. This will give you the ability
to handle the Text or Caption property as if it were a custom property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Text and Caption properties of an ActiveX control are synonymous.
