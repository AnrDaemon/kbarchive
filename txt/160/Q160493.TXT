TITLE   :Nwlnkrip Data Structures Corrupt when Using Demand Dial NIC
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In stress redial conditions, using a demand-dial network interface card on a
Windows NT server may result in a line ready message being ignored.

CAUSE
=====

High intensity redial stress causes corruption of client node hash table lists.
When a line ready message is received on a demand-dial network interface card
that has not been reset from the previous client, it is ignored. However,
subsequent line not ready messages are processed, resulting in a RemoveListEntry
operation on the node that has already been removed from the list.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem does not occur if you configure the RAS server IPX configuration to
not assign the same network number to all IPX clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
