SUMMARY
=======

In creating a report programmatically, you can use the following formula to
determine the width for objects on the report:

   625/6 report units per pixel

MORE INFORMATION
================

The FONTMETRIC function returns return various attributes of a specified font.
For example, FONTMETRIC(6) returns the average character width in pixels of the
current font.

So, to calculate the average width needed in a report for a five-character field,
you could use the following formula:

      reportwidth = 625/6 * ;
         (FONTMETRIC(6, <cFontName>, <nFontSize>, <cFontStyle>) * ;
         nNumCharacters)

nNumCharacters specifies the number of characters for which you need to allow
room.

The following line of code would store the average width needed in a report for a
five-character field in the font "Times New Roman," size 12, style Normal.

      reportwidth = 625/6 * (FONTMETRIC(6, "Times New Roman", 12, "N") * 5)
