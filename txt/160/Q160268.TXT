PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbnetserv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Occasionally the Microsoft TN3270E Server will not add a TN3270E header to a
data message destined for the TN3270E client. This can cause the client's
session hang.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 2.11 and 2.11
Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to support several of the new functions in TN3270E, a header must
prefix each data message. The header contains a DATA-TYPE field, which tells the
receiver how to interpret the data portion of the message.

Some possible values for the DATA-TYPE field are:

         Data-type Name Code                Meaning
         --------------   ----   ---------------------------------
         3270-DATA        0x00      The data portion of the message
                                    contains only the 3270 data stream.

         RESPONSE         0x02      The data portion of the message
                                    constitutes device-status information
                                    and the RESPONSE-FLAG field indicates
                                    whether this is a positive or negative
                                    response (see below).

         BIND-IMAGE       0x03      The data portion of the message is
                                    the SNA bind image from the session
                                    established between the server and the
                                    host application.

         UNBIND           0x04      The data portion of the message is
                                    an Unbind reason code.
