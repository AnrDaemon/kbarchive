TITLE   :XGEN: Directory Import Generates Unusable Random Password
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You are doing a Directory Import from the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program under Windows NT 4.0 to a computer running Microsoft
Exchange server under Windows NT 3.51. If, on the Account Creation dialog box,
you select the check boxes "Create Windows NT account" and "Generate random
password," the password generated in the PSW file contains non-ASCII characters
in the extended character set. This password is not useable.

CAUSE
=====

Because Windows NT is not based on the ASCII character set, an extended
character set is used to generate the random password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
