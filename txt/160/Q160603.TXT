TITLE   :No Output from DBMON Using OutputDebugString While Debugging
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

DBMON is a utility that can be used to monitor output from an application that
calls the OutputDebugString function when the application is not being run from
within a debugger.

The problem is that no output is available when the application is being run from
within a service.

CAUSE
=====

In OutputDebugString, the DBWinMutex is created with a NULL SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES.
This implies a default security descriptor, which means the ACL of the security
context that OutputDebugString is called within. However, this means that this
mutex can only be used within the security context that first created this
mutex, and no other security context can use OutputDebugString to talk to DBMON.
The problem is really in the first code to call OutputDebugString, when running
from a service running under another security context.


RESOLUTION
==========

Apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For
