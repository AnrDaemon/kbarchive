TITLE   :XADM: Errmsg: Initialization of Dynamic Link Library Kernel32
PRODUCT :Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kberrmsg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the National Language Support (NLS) Configuration Tool on your
Windows NT Server computer, when you reboot, the following error message is
displayed during the initialization portion of Kernel32.dll:

   STOP: C0000142 {DLL INITIALIZATION FAILED}
   Initialization of the dynamic link library
   C:\<winntroot>\SYTEM32\KERNEL32.DLL failed
   .the process is
   terminating abnormally

Depending on your specific configuration, your system may reboot, causing it to
loop. Choosing LastKnownGoodConfiguration has no effect, nor does running
Windows NT Recovery. A complete reinstall and backup recovery is necessary at
this point.

IMPORTANT: The NLS Configuration Tool is not supported on Windows NT Server
versions 3.5 and earlier.

WORKAROUND
==========

If code pages need to be installed on the Windows NT Server computer, follow the
directions provided to manually install them. This utility has been replaced on
the Web Site, so there should not be any further problems using this tool, if
you downloaded the file recently.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NLS utility is used to install code pages to your Windows NT Server. It
installs the code pages that are available in Windows NT Server. If you
experience any problems, call Microsoft Technical Support, report the site the
utility was downloaded from, and the date and time it was downloaded.
