TITLE   :FreeHand 4.0 Does not Print Properly with EMF Spooling
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Aldus FreeHand does not print properly when using enhanced metafile (EMF)
spooling on a computer running Windows NT Server 4.0. The job only partially
spools to the Print server.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 implements EMF spooling by recording the graphic device interface
(GDI) function calls that produce the application's graphic object on the
specified printer. This record is an EMF-format file, called a print spool file.
Windows NT builds the spool file quickly, and then returns control to the
application. In the background, the spool file is spooled to the server, and the
server converts the EMF data into a format suitable for the output device.
Freehand 4.0 does not work Properly when using EMF. This behavior will occur by
default in PCL Mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the Print Issue described above, do one of the following:

NOTE: Any of the three steps below can be used to resolve the issue mentioned
above.

1. Disable EMF Spooling on the Server

   a. In the Printers folder, click the printer whose properties you want to
      change.

   b. From the File menu, click Properties.

   c. Click PrintProcessor.

   d. Click the Always Spool RAW Datatype option.

2. Upgrade to FreeHand 5.0

3. Print to the Server using Postscript (EMF Turned off by Default)
