TITLE   :RUI_TERM Hangs on Inactive LU After Session Cycle
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbprogrammingkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are calling RUI_TERM on an inactive LUA LU, the RUI_TERM may stop
responding and never complete. This was observed on the second time through the
following call sequence:

   WinRUIStartup
    <- OK
   RUI_INIT ->
    <- RUI_INIT error (LU inactive)
   RUI_TERM ->
    <- LUA_OK
   WinRUICleanup
    <- Error 1 (WLUASYSNOTREADY)

The first time through, the RUI_TERM completes without a problem. However, when
executing this loop a second time, the RUI_TERM never completes.

NOTE: If the connection supporting the LUA LU is not "Active", or if SNA Server
has not received an ACTLU for this LU, the SNA Server 2.x Administrator program
or SNA Server 3.0 Manager will display the LU as "Inactive."

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by a problem in the SNA Server RUI DLL (Winrui32.dll for Windows
NT or Windows 95 clients, or Winrui.dll for Windows 3.x clients).

RESOLUTION
==========

An update is available to correct this problem. This fix is already included in
SNA Server 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
and 2.11. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 2.11
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
