TITLE   :PRB: Page Activate Event Does Not Set Focus to Different Page
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the Activate event of a Page in a PageFrame to set focus to a different
page does not work.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable all pages except the one that is to have
focus. For example, in the Deactivate event of the first page place the
following code:

      This.Parent.Page1.Enabled = .F.
      This.Parent.Page2.Enabled = .F.
      This.Parent.Page3.Enabled = .F.
      This.Parent.Page4.SetFocus

This code disables all the other pages in the PageFrame and sets the focus to the
remaining active page, Page 4 in this case. Since this code is in the Deactivate
event of the prior page, no problems occur.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the NODEFAULT keyword does not produce the intended behavior. However, the
addition of the NODEFAULT keyword to the Activate event causes the behavior of
the examples below to differ.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Form that contains a PageFrame object.

2. Change the PageCount property in the PageFrame to 4.

3. In the Activate of Page2, place the following code:

         This.Parent.ActivePage=4
         This.Parent.Page4.SetFocus
         NODEFAULT  && This line is optional.

4. Run the Form and use the Right Arrow key to move to Page2 of the PageFrame.

If the NODEFAULT keyword is in the Activate event, the first time you use the
Right Arrow key to move to Page2, Page4 briefly gains focus, then focus returns
to Page2. If you use the Right Arrow key to traverse pages, each time Page2 gets
focus from the Right Arrow key, the focus is directed to Page4 correctly.

If NODEFAULT is removed from the above example, focus is never directed to Page4
after activating Page2. Moving from page to page behaves as if no code exists in
the Activate event.
