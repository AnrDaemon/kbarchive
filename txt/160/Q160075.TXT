TITLE   :FIX: Problems Debugging in Case-sensitive Database

KEYWORDS:kbDebug kbEEdition kbide kbSQL kbVC kbVC500fix kbSQLProg

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a case-sensitive database on Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 and create two
stored procedures with the same name but with a different case, you may see
inconsistent behavior when you execute or debug one of those procedures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To reproduce the problem, create two procedures in a case-sensitive SQL Server
6.5 database:

      ---------
      CREATE PROCEDURE test AS
      DECLARE @a INTEGER
      DECLARE @A INTEGER
      select @a = 10
      select @A = 20
      print 'test done'
      RETURN
      ---------
      CREATE PROCEDURE TEST AS
      DECLARE @a INTEGER
      DECLARE @A INTEGER
      select @a = 1
      select @A = 2
      print 'TEST done'
      RETURN

When stored procedure names differ only by case (for example, one called test and
another called TEST), inconsistent behavior may occur when you execute or debug
one of those procedures. For example, when you start debugging 'TEST,' the
debugger may show the source code for TEST but it will actually execute 'test'.
If you have variables common to both procedures, you will see the values as used
in 'test' in the watch window.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.
