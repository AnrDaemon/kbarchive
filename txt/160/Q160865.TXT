The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding users from a personal address book (PAB) to the Access Permissions
list in Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 you may receive the
following error message when you click OK:

   All your access permissions could not be set on the server. Those that were
   not set have been removed from your shared schedule file. Choose set access
   permissions from the tools menu to see which permissions could not be set.

If you log off and re-enter Schedule+, you receive the following error message:

   Unable to modify access permissions. The item has been deleted.

If you then view access permissions for the account, the addresses will no longer
be listed.

CAUSE
=====

The error occurs when users are chosen from the personal address book (PAB). If
the addresses are chosen from the Global Address List this feature works as
expected, and you do not receive the error message.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
