TITLE   :3270 Sessions Unexpectedly Return to SSCP Screen
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,3.0,4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 4.0, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server clients using 3270 display sessions are returned to the SSCP (VTAM
Signon) screen unexpectedly while actively working in a host application. The
SNA Server may log one or more of the following events in the Windows NT
Application Event Log when this problem occurs:

   Event ID: 4
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1133) Message Sequence Error

   EXPLANATION
   The SNA server (node) received an invalid or unexpected message from a
   remote node on an SNA session. The remote system has a possible
   configuration or internal logic error.

   SUBCODE INFORMATION
   X'1133' The node received a request with an invalid sequence number.

   Event ID: 12
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1118) Negative Response from Remote System (SENSE = 200D)

   SUBCODE INFORMATION
   X'1118' The local SNA server (node) received an SNA negative response
   on an SNA session from a remote system, which indicates a protocol
   violation by the 3270 emulator. The SNA sense code shown gives details
   of the type of error. See "IBM Systems Network Architecture: Formats"
   for an explanation of the sense code.

   Event ID: 13
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: (1141) Message Sequence Error (SENSE = 2001)

   EXPLANATION
   The SNA server (node) received an invalid or unexpected message from a
   remote node during an SNA session. The cause is probably a logic error
   in the remote system. The SNA sense data shown gives details of the type
   of error.

   SUBCODE INFORMATION
   X'1141' Session-level protocol violation in an SNA message from the
   partner
   LU.

CAUSE
=====

This has only been reported on SNA Servers with 802.2 connections to IBM 3174
Control Units on Ethernet networks. The problem occurs because a 3174 Ethernet
gateway may send a duplicate SNA sequence number to the SNA Server when the 3174
is handling an SNA frame between 1490 and 1493 bytes in size. This leads to a
condition where a frame may be re-sent by the 3174 causing the symptoms
discussed previously. In addition, the problem only occurs if the 3174 is
running 3174 Microcode Level C6.1 or C6.2.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix for this problem is available from IBM. Contact IBM support and request
IBM 3174 PTR #B27E.
