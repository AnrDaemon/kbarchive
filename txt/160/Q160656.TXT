PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Performance Monitor in Windows NT version 4.0 does not display the same results
as Performance Monitor in Windows version 3.51 when you change the Application
Performance Boost setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT 3.51 and earlier boosts the foreground application responsiveness by
boosting the foreground thread priority base. Windows NT 4.0 boosts the
foreground responsiveness by assigning a longer timeslice (quantum) to the
foreground thread than what background threads receive, not by assigning a
higher thread priority.
