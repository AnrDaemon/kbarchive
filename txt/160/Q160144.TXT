SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to restore the Microsoft Exchange Directory or Information
Store from an online backup, you may receive the following error:

   You do not have permission to access portions of \<directory>. Please
   see the owner or administrator to get permission. Error writing alternate
   file data.

This error occurs when Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 5 (SP5) is applied. SP5
replaces the Ntbackup.exe that is installed by Microsoft Exchange Server in the
<system root>\System32 directory.

To resolve this problem, copy Ntbackup.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Server
compact disc into the <system root>\System32 directory.
