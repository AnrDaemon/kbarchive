SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use the Data control to connect to a password-protected Access
database at design time, you receive the following error message:

   Not a valid password

Specifically, this error occurs when you set the RecordSource property of the
Data control.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Properties window, set the following properties for the Data control:

      Property             Value of Property
      ----------------   ---------------------
      DatabaseName         ATEST.MDB
      Connect              ;pwd=aaa
      RecordSource         Table1

NOTE: You must set the DatabaseName property first, then set the connect
property. If the properties are not set in this order, you receive the same
error message.

IMPORTANT: This functionality is broken in Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 4 (SP4).


STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. In the Load event for Form1, paste the following code:

      Private Sub Form_Load()

        Dim DB As Database
        Dim tblDef As TableDef, fld As Field

        Set DB = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).CreateDatabase("C:\Atest.mdb", _
            dbLangGeneral, dbEncrypt)
        DB.NewPassword "", "aaa"
        ' Create new TableDef.
        Set tblDef = DB.CreateTableDef("Table1")
        ' Add field to tblDef.
        Set fld = tblDef.CreateField("Field1", dbInteger)
        tblDef.Fields.Append fld
        ' Save TableDef definition by appending it to TableDefs collection.
        DB.TableDefs.Append tblDef
        DB.Close
        MsgBox "Atest.mdb and Table1 is created."

      End Sub

3. Press the F5 key to run the project. A password-protected database called
   Atest.mdb is created.

4. Start another instance of Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is again created by
   default.

5. Add a Data control to Form1.

6. In the Properties window, set the DatabaseName property of the Data control
   to "C:\Atest.mdb." If you try to set the RecordSource property, you receive
   the above-mentioned error message.
