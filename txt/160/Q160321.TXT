SUMMARY
=======

On the Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) CD-ROM, the four user callback
function entry points in the RASAdmin.dll (supplied by the user) in Windows NT
4.0 must have _stdcall in their function declarations. The declarations in these
files should include CALLBACK or WINAPI or __stdcall as is specified for other
callback functions. Look at the page for EnumICMProfilesProc for an example of a
callback function declaration. The documentation errors are located in the
following files:

   MSDN/Products/Win32SDK/Win32 Programmer's Reference/Reference/
   Functions/RASGetIpAddressForUser

   MSDN/Products/Win32SDK/Win32 Programmer's Reference/Reference/
   Functions/RASReleaseIpAddress

   Functions/RASAcceptNewConnection

MORE INFORMATION
================

Third-party RAS server administration DLLs have four entry points declared in
the WIN32SDK programmer's reference. The declarations do not include the
_stdcall calling sequence specifier. If you build your DLL using Visual C++ 4.x
defaults, your DLL does not work correctly. You can either set your project to
use __stdcall as the default by choosing:

"Build\Settings\C/C++:Category Code Generation:Calling Convention __stdcall"
(without the quotation marks)

-or-

you can change your code and Rassapi.h to use the following function
declarations:

   DWORD APIENTRY RasAdminGetIpAddressForUser(
       WCHAR *lpszUserName,   // pointer to the name of the remote user
       WCHAR *lpszPortName,   // pointer to the name of the port
       IPADDR *pipAddress,         // pointer to the IP address
       BOOL *bNotifyRelease   // indicates whether RAS should call
   RasAdminReleaseIpAddress
      );
   VOID APIENTRY RasAdminReleaseIpAddress(
       WCHAR *lpszUserName,   // pointer to the name of the remote user
       WCHAR *lpszPortName,   // pointer to the name of the port
       IPADDR *pipAddress         // pointer to the IP address
      );
   BOOL APIENTRY RasAdminAcceptNewConnection(
       RAS_PORT_1 *pRasPort1, // pointer to connection information
       RAS_PORT_STATISTICS *pRasStats, // pointer to port statistics
       RAS_PARAMETERS *pRasParams   // pointer to an array of parameters
      );

   VOID APIENTRY RasAdminConnectionHangupNotification(
       RAS_PORT_1 *pRasPort1, // pointer to connection information
       RAS_PORT_STATISTICS *pRasStats, // pointer to port statistics
       RAS_PARAMETERS *pRasParams   // pointer to an array of parameters
      );

NOTE: The remaining RasAdmin... functions are correctly declared in rassapi.h
using APIENTRY.
