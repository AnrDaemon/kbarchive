TITLE   :MSNDS Drops Connections to More Than Eight Servers
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product
PROD/VER::2,2.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork osr2 win95kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS) to
connect to NetWare servers, idle connections to drives mapped to NetWare servers
are disconnected after approximately 10 minutes if there are connections to more
than 8 servers.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the MSNDS version of the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks (NWRedir). This client assumes a maximum of eight server attachments,
and automatically disconnects any idle connections to servers after the first
eight.

This limitation was originally designed for compatibility with older versions of
Novell's NetWare client. However, this limitation does not apply to Novell's
NetWare Directory Services (NDS) clients. In this respect, MSNDS is not fully
compliant with the comparable Novell client.

RESOLUTION
==========


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This symptom has also been observed with the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks (bindery version, without MSNDS). Although this behavior is by design
for the bindery client, it can be worked around with the following steps:

1. Obtain and install the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
   (MSNDS). For information about obtaining MSNDS, please see the following
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q138709 Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

2. Obtain and install the update identified in the "Status" section above.

3. Configure the MSNDS client to log in to the bindery server instead of to an
   NDS tree. For information about how to do this, see the following article in
   the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q164558 Configuring MSNDS to Log in to a NetWare Bindery Server
