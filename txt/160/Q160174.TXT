TITLE   :DOCERR: Steps to Make PPTP Connection Incomplete in WNTRK 4.0
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0; :
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - MSPRESS Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Page 336 of the Windows NT Server Networking Guide for Windows NT version 4.0
does not completely document the process of making a PPTP connection to an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the section titled "Secure Access to
Corporate Networks over the Internet" that begins on page 335.

On page 336 the text states:

   The client first makes a call to the ISP. After that connection is
   established, the client makes another call to the RAS server located anywhere
   on the Internet or the ISP and that establishes the PPTP tunnel.

This section fails to explain that in order to make the second call to complete a
PPTP connection, you must make special changes to the Phonebook entry in the
Dial-Up Networking connectoid.

RESOLUTION
==========

First, rather than entering an actual phone number in the Phone number Dialog
box, you must enter either the IP address or the name of the remote host.

Also, you must ensure that the Dial using option for this connection specifies a
RASPPTPM VPN port.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The end of this section also references the two diagrams in the section with the
labels of Terra Flora and Seville. However, no such labels appear on the
diagrams.
