-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a find and replace while the Office Assistant is running, the
balloon message that informs you of how many replacements were made does not
include an OK or a Close button. The Cancel button in the Find and Replace
dialog box does not change to Close while the balloon message is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem so that the Cancel button in the Find and Replace
dialog box changes to Close, use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Click the Find and Replace dialog box.

Method 2: Press any key.

Method 3: Click the balloon message.

The balloon message is closed, the focus is returned to the Find and Replace
dialog box, and the Cancel button changes to Close.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.


MORE INFORMATION
================

A balloon message is an interactive message that requires you to confirm or
cancel an action before you can close it. The balloon message that appears after
you complete a find and replace operation does not include an OK or a Close
button. If you click the Office Assistant while the balloon message is visible,
the Office Assistant prompts you for a Help topic. If you click in the document
while the balloon message is visible, you get a system beep.
