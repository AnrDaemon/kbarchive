TITLE   :File Manager Will Not Browse Below the NetWare Volume
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use File Manager in Windows NT 4.0 to connect to a Novell NetWare
volume, you cannot browse further than the volume level. For example, if you
double-click a volume, File Manager maps a drive to that volume rather than
opening a view of that volume. File Manager in Windows NT 3.51 displays a list
of folders beneath the volume when you double-click the volume.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use Windows NT Explorer to work around this problem in Windows NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
