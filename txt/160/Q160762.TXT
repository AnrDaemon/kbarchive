======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.2x, 6.0, 6.5 
 - Microsoft Open Database Connectivity, version 1.x, 2.5, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If ODBC 2.x drivers pass function calls to the ODBC 1.x Driver Manager, you may
receive the following errors from any 16-bit application that uses ODBC on a
Windows 16-bit environment (such as Windows for Workgroups 3.11 or Windows
3.1).

   ODBC Call Failed

   -or-

   3146 error - driver doesn't support the function

CAUSE
=====

Early versions of the ODBC Driver Manager (1.x) were placed in the Windows
directory on 16-bit Windows platforms, while subsequent versions of the ODBC
Driver Manager (2.x and above) were placed in the Windows\System directory. The
best way to determine if you are encountering the problem is to search the
computer for the Odbc.dll file, and verify the version in File Manager. You can
do this by clicking on the file and then clicking Properties on the File menu.
If the first possible Odbc.dll file in the path is the ODBC 1.x Driver Manager,
you are most likely encountering the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the ODBC 1.x Driver Manager (Odbc.dll) from
the path and/or place the ODBC 2.x Driver Manager (Odbc.dll) in the path first.

MORE INFORMATION
