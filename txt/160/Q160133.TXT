The Internet Multiplayer Patch for Golf 3.0 (Glfpatch.exe) makes it easier to
start modem-to-modem multiplayer Golf games, and provides the ability to play
Internet multiplayer Golf 3.0 games on Zone.com.

NOTE: When you install the Internet Multiplayer Patch for Golf 3.0, you can no
longer play an Internet multiplayer Golf game outside of the Zone. To play an
Internet multiplayer Golf game, both players must install the patch, and then
sign in to the Zone.

If you install the Multiplayer Patch for Golf 3.0, and then later want to play a
multiplayer game on the Internet without going through Zone.com, you must remove
and reinstall Microsoft Golf version 3.0.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

   Add/Remove.

4. Click Remove All.

5. Click Yes when you prompted to remove Microsoft Golf 3.0.

6. When you are prompted to restart Windows, do so.

To reinstall Microsoft Golf 3.0, insert the Microsoft Golf 3.0 CD-ROM into the
CD-ROM drive, and then click OK when you are prompted to install the program. If
you are not prompted automatically to install the program:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
