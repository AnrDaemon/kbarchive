The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The officially supported method for Systems Management Server access to NetWare
servers is to use a NetWare account that is equivalent to the NetWare
supervisor.

Where such access cannot be granted for the Systems Management Server Service
Account (likely due to political or management boundaries), the following
alternative method for granting access for Systems Management Server services
can be used.

NOTE: Because of a change in the method Systems Management Server employs to
check its connection to a NetWare server, the steps outlined below may only be
used when you are using Systems Management Server version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Apart from the full level of access documented in the Systems Management Server
manuals, there are two levels of access documented below. The first level of
access (gained after following the first five steps below) discussed allows
client inventory and Package Command Manager (PCM) jobs to be sent to clients.
Using the first level of access, Program Group Control (PGC) jobs will fail,
because the Systems Management Server Service Account under which the Despooler
runs on the site server, will not have the necessary NetWare volume rights.

In the following examples, NetWare command line utilities are used. The sample
Systems Management Server Service Account used is called SMSSERVICE.

To Restrict the Service Rights to a NetWare Login/Distribution Server
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a NetWare login account using the same login name as that the Systems
   Management Server services use on the Site server. The account will need the
   same password as the Windows NT account.

2. Initially grant the Systems Management Server account Read, Write, Create,
   Erase, Modify, File Scan, and Access Control trustee directory rights to the
   root directory of the volume to which Systems Management Server will be
   installed. (Full trustee directory rights are required for the initial
   installation. These rights are revoked in a later step). Using the NetWare
   GRANT utility, issue the following command:

         GRANT R W C E M F A  FOR vol: TO SMSSERVICE (vol: = SMS installation
         volume)

3. Create a NetWare domain within the Systems Management Server Administrator,
   or add the NetWare server to an existing NetWare domain. Specify the NetWare
   server name as normal, but make sure the installation volume is specified.
   Once the site property has been initiated, the Systems Management Server Site
   Configuration Manager (SCMAN) is responsible for creating the necessary
   directory structure and permissions on the NetWare server. When the NetWare
   server has been processed by SCMAN, Maintenance Manager will populate the new
   logon server directories.

4. Once the NetWare server has been successfully added to the domain, and the
   logon servers directories have been populated, change the rights to the
   Systems Management Server directory, and remove the rights that were
   previously given at the root directory level. Grant rights to the Systems
   Management Server directory for the Systems Management Server Service
   Account, using the following command:

         GRANT S FOR vol:SMS TO SMSSERVICE

   Then remove rights for SMSERVICE from the root directory of the Systems
   Management Server volume, using the following command:

         REMOVE SMSSERVICE FROM vol:

5. To allow Systems Management Server to modify the NetWare system logon script
   in the Public directory, and to allow SCMAN to modify the NetWare system
   login script, grant the appropriate rights to the Net$log.dat file and the
   Public directory, using the following command:

         GRANT ALL FOR SYS:PUBLIC\NET$LOG.DAT TO SMSSERVICE

   Because Systems Management Server backs up the system login script, Create
   rights in the Public directory are required; therefore, issue the following
   command:

         GRANT C FOR SYS:PUBLIC TO SMSSERVICE

Because PCM packages are despooled to the Logon.srv\Pcmpkg.src directory on
NetWare servers, and the Systems Management Server site services now have rights
below the SMS directory, PCM packages can be despooled normally. However,
because PGC packages are despooled to directories below the root directory of a
NetWare volume, the above changes will not allow Systems Management Server to
despool these packages. The additional step below is required if you desire PGC
support. However, this requires the Systems Management Server services to have
access to the root directory of a NetWare server, which may be unacceptable to
some companies.

Additional Step for PGC Support
-------------------------------

1. Grant the NetWare Systems Management Server account Read, Write, Create,
   Erase, Modify, File Scan, and Access Control rights to the root directory of
   the Systems Management Server volume, using the following command:

         GRANT R W C E M F A FOR vol: TO SMSSERVICE
