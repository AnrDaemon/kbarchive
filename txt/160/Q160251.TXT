PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0 5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kberrmsg kbinterop kbole kbvfp kbvfp500aBUG kbvfp500bugkbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs after you make an OLE Automation call to Corel
WordPerfect 7.0:

   VFP.EXE Caused an Invalid Page Fault in module OLEAUT32.DLL

CAUSE
=====

WordPerfect is attempting to send a return value to Visual FoxPro.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use an assignment statement to call the object methods.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Corel WordPerfect 7.0 does allow OLE Automation. In Visual FoxPro, you can use
the CreateObject command to create a reference to a WordPerfect object, but you
will still get the error when you try to call any of its methods.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Type the following commands in the Visual FoxPro Command window:

      oWP = CREATEOBJECT("WordPerfect.PerfectScript")
      oWP.FileNew

WordPerfect 7.0 actually creates a new document before Visual FoxPro generates an
error.

To work around the problem, change the last command to the following:

      result = oWP.FileNew()
