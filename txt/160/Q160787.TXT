TITLE   :D-link DE-220 ISA Ethernet Adapter will Not Install
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the D-link DE-220 ISA Ethernet Adapter from The
Control Panel Network utility, you will receive the following error.

   Please insert the disk labeled 'Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM' into <x>

where <x> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM.

Neither the Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM will work. No
matter what path is defined, the message just repeats itself. The only option is
to cancel.

CAUSE
=====

When you install the D-Link DE-220 ISA Ethernet Adapter, Control Panel pulls the
driver and the oemsetup file from the following path:

   <cdrom drive>:\I386\Drvlib.nic\Ne2k.isa\ 

The first time that the driver is installed, the Oemsetup.inf file will be saved
as Oemnad0.inf in the %SytemRoot%\System32 directory. Repeated attempts to
install will result in the setup file being copied as oemnadx.inf where x is
incremented in each subsequent installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, the Oemnad0.inf file must be edited. The file is
located in the %SystemRoot%\System32 directory. To edit this file, perform the
following steps:

1. Open the file in Notepad.

2. Search for the text string: [Source Media Descriptions]. Immediately below
   this text will be the following text.

   1 = "Windows NT Workstation DRVLIB"
   2 = "Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM" , TAGFILE = cdrom.w

3. Delete the text after "CD-ROM". It should now look like this:

   1 = "Windows NT Workstation DRVLIB"
   2 = "Windows NT Workstation CD-ROM"

4. Save the changes.

The driver will now install from either the Windows NT Workstation or Windows NT
Server CD-ROM.

The OEMSETUP file can also be edited in the same way and the files placed on a
floppy disk. Then use the <Have disk..> option in the Control Panel
Network utility when installing the adapter.
