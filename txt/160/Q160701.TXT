PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.0,1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbInventory smsinvkbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

On computers running the OS/2 2.x, 3.x, or 4.x operating system, memory over 16
MB will not be detected or reported by the Systems Management Server Inventory
Agent.

CAUSE
=====

To determine the amount of available memory, Systems Management Server makes a
16-bit API call. This call does not return the correct amount of memory on a
32-bit version of OS/2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. A supported fix is now available for version 1.2
only, but it has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service
Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.
