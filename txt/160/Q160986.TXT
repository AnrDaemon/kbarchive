TITLE   :SMS: Dosetup.exe Fails with "Runs with UNC Name" Option Enabled
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.1,1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork kbPGC smspgc

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When Dosetup.exe is used on the Configuration command line of a shared network
application, it will fail to configure the registry of a computer running
Windows NT or Windows 95, when the package properties are defined with the
option "Runs with UNC Name."

CAUSE
=====

This problem is due to a limitation of all 16-bit applications. Because
Dosetup.exe is a 16-bit application, it cannot get a current working directory
of a UNC name.

This limitation is also documented in the Systems Management Server 1.2 Release
Notes under "Shared Applications and UNC Paths."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, set up the package to either use "Requires Drive
Letter" or "Requires Specific Drive Letter."

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the client runs the shared application, the user will receive a message
stating that a one-time installation is required for this application.
Continuing, the client will then receive the following message:

   '<your application>' has not been successfully configured.

The Pgg.log file on the client shows the following information:

      [10/26/96 13:04:28] Program Group Control ==> An Application specific
      error occurred: SMSSETUP - <your application>: Cannot access SETUP.EXE
      on application server.

      [10/26/96 13:05:16] Program Group Control Start ==> '<your application>'
      has not been successfully configured.
