SUMMARY
=======

If you create a form and add tables to its DataEnvironment from a .dbc file in a
certain directory, and you move the form and directory structure, you may find
that it will continue to access the .dbc file in the original directory. If you
wish to ensure that a form with tables in its Data Environment uses tables from
a specific location (that is, from a specific .dbc file or files), specify the
path to the .dbc file for each cursor object in the BeforeOpenTables event
method code of the form's DataEnvironment object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to force your form to use tables from a .dbc file from the directory
C:\Mydatadir, specify the path to the .dbc file in the DataEnvironment
BeforeOpenTables event method code. The .dbc in this example is called
Mydbc.dbc. Regardless of the location of the .dbc file used when a form is
designed, if you use code like the one below, it uses the .dbc file in
C:\Mydatadir when you run the form.

    * Place this in the DataEnvironment.BeforeOpenTables() code
    LOCAL lcDatapath, lnBufferMode, lnI, lcI

    * This could be in a format of "\\<unc path name>\share\" or
    * "<drive>:\directory\"
    lcDatapath = "C:\myDataDir\"

   lnBufferMode = 5

   FOR lnI = 1 TO 10            && Assume only 10 or less Cursor objects
      * This assumes that the cursors have been left with the default names
      * in the format of Cursor1, Cursor2, etc.
      IF TYPE("this.cursor"+ALLTR(STR(lnI)))=="O" && Is this cursor an object?

         lcI=ALLTR(STR(lnI))    && Convert the counter to a string

         * Macro substitute the string value into cursorname to set property
         THIS.CURSOR&lcI..DATABASE=(lcDatapath)+'mydbc.dbc'

         * You may also set other properties for cursors here
         THIS.CURSOR&lcI..BUFFERMODEOVERRIDE=lnBufferMode
      ENDIF
   ENDFOR
