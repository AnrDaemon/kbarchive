SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to export the Connections container to a text file.
Exporting the Connections container to a text file allows you to view its
contents in a different format than that provided by the Raw Properties command
in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export the Connections container to a text file, follow these steps:

1. Create a new text file called Connect.txt in the root folder of drive C that
   contains the following lines:

      [Export]
      DirectoryService=<server1>
      HomeServer=<server2>
      Basepoint=/o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=configuration/cn=connections
      ExportObject=All
      InformationLevel=Full
      RawMode=Yes
      HiddenObjects=Yes
      Subcontainers=Yes

      [Import]
      DirectoryService=<server1>
      Basepoint=/o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=configuration
      Container=
      InformationLevel=Full
      OverwriteProperties=Yes
      RawMode=Yes

   where <server1> is the name of the computer on which the directory
   service is running and <server2> is the name of the Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer.

2. Use the Header.exe program from the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit to
   create a comma-delimited text file called Connect.csv in the root folder of
   drive C. The file should contain all the attributes from the Mailbox Gateway
   object class.

3. Type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /e c:\connect.csv /o c:\connect.txt

NOTE: After you export the Connections container to the Connect.csv file, you can
use the following command to import the contents of the Connect.csv file to the
Connections container:

   c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /i c:\connect.csv /o c:\connect.txt

Because the directory contains most of the necessary configuration information
for the connectors, you should not back up the Connections container by
exporting it to a text file. Importing the text file at a later time is
essentially the same as restoring the directory.
