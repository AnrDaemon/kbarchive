TITLE   :Misleading Error 692 with RAS if HyperTerminal Owns COM Port
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you invoke a Dial-Up Networking connection on a COM port that HyperTerminal
already has open, or if you try to open a HyperTerminal session by dialing
through a port already in use by Dial-Up Networking in Windows NT 4.0, you get
uninformative and misleading error messages.


If HyperTerminal already opened an active session on a serial (COM) port and you
attempt to open a Dial-Up Networking (DUN) session on the same port, you get the
following error message in the Windows NT 4.0 graphical interface (GUI):

   Error 692: Hardware failure in port or attached device.

If Dial-Up Networking has already opened an active communications session on a
given COM port, when you attempt to open a HyperTerminal session on that same
port you will simply see the word(s):

Disconnected

-or-

No Dialtone

in the HyperTerminal interface.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
