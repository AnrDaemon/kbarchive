TITLE   :BUG: Printing Unconverted 2.x Report from Preview Causes Fault
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbvfp500 kbvfp600

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 5.0, using the Print button in the Report Preview toolbar to
print an unconverted FoxPro 2.x report causes Visual FoxPro to terminate with an
Invalid Page Fault.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, convert the 2.x report into Visual FoxPro 5.0
format before using the Print button in the Report Preview toolbar to print the
report.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro 5.0 allows you to preview or print an unconverted report that was
created using previous versions of FoxPro. Visual FoxPro 5.0 terminates,
however, if you try to print an unconverted FoxPro 2.x report in the preview
mode using the Print button on the toolbar. This behavior does not happen in
Visual FoxPro 3.0 because Visual FoxPro 3.0 does not have the Print button for
the report preview toolbar.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a quick report in FoxPro 2.x. (Using the customer table in the
   \Tutorial folder.)

2. Run Visual FoxPro 5.0.

3. Without converting the 2.x report, in the Command window, type in the
   following command:

   " REPORT FORM <2.x reportname> PREVIEW " (without the quotation marks)

4. When the preview comes up, press the Print button on the Report Preview
   toolbar to print the report.

NOTE: Visual FoxPro terminates at this point with an Invalid Page Fault.
