Packard (HP) JetDirect cards using the IPX protocol. This functionality is
available from the following sources:

 - From Hewlett-Packard. Contact HP for the appropriate software drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Server 4.0 provides support for HP JetDirect cards using the IPX/SPX
protocol with the File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) service.

Windows NT does support connecting to HP JetDirect cards using the TCP/IP
protocol with the LPR Print Monitor. This is part of the Microsoft TCP/IP
Printing Services. You can add this service on the Services tab in Network
properties.
