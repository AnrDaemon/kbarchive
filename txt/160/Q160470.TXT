TITLE   :Stop 0x0000000a IPX Sends Browser an Incomplete Datagram
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT 4.0 may experience a Stop 0x0000000a error with
the IPX IPX\SPX compatible transport installed on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

There was a problem with Rdr.sys, where IPX sends the browser an incomplete
datagram indication. The datagram indication determines if there is more data in
the buffer to be processed. The browser does not always ask for the remainder of
the buffer and the result is a Stop 0x0000000a error.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
