TITLE   :Terminal Type Negotiation Fails w/RUMBA v3.2J TN3270 Emulator
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:2.0,2.1,2.11,2.11 SP1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbnetwork

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to SNA Server's TN3270/e service with the Wall Data
RUMBA v3.2J TN3270 emulator, you may see the following errors on the emulator:

   Terminal Type Negotiation failure

   -and-

   Communication error 501

CAUSE
=====

The Wall Data RUMBA v3.2J TN3270 emulator sends a message that is out of the
normal sequence, but still legal. This causes the TN3270E Server to renegotiate
an option it had already negotiated.

The TN3720 negotiation would never complete if the emulator sent a "Won't
TN3270E" command after it had sent a "Will TERMTYPE" command. This is because
the TN3270 Server sends a "Do TERMTYPE" command in response to the "Won't
TN3270E" command, even though the emulator had already sent the "Will TERMTYPE"
command.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. If the emulator
sends "Will TERMTYPE" before the "Won't TN3270E," the TN3270/e Service doesn't
send a "Do TERMTYPE."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, and 2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
