OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a 16-bit CPIC application against the SNA Server WinCPIC thunking
DLL (wincpic.dll from <snaroot>\system\thunk\) on a computer running
Windows NT Server, the following error message may appear:

   <application> has caused a general protection fault in module
   krnl386.exe at 1:9044

The offset of the failure may vary.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server WINCPIC thunking DLL is not properly freeing memory, which
eventually causes the application's 32-KB local heap to be exhausted, leading to
the failure.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.1, 2.11,
2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest
Microsoft SNA Server 2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on
