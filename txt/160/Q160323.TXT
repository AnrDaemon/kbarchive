TITLE   :XCLN: Messages Created Using Form Do Not Sort Properly by Date
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer to create a form, messages created
using that form may not sort properly in the Microsoft Exchange client. If the
form contains a date field and you attempt to sort the messages by date, the
messages may not be sorted properly.

CAUSE
=====

When you create a form that contains a date field, and then use that form to
create a message, the information in the date field is converted to text before
the message appears in the Microsoft Exchange client. Because the field contains
text data instead of dates, you may be unable to successfully sort the messages
by date.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, configure the date field so that the year appears
before the month and day (YY/MM/DD). When the date field is configured in this
manner, the messages are sorted properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Forms Designer that is
included with the Microsoft Exchange clients listed at the beginning of this
article. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
