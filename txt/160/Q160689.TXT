TITLE   :Systems Management Server Query Appears to Lose Data
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER:winnt:1.2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbinterop kbDatabase kbsmsAdmin smsadmin smsdatabase

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create large queries based on the Identification table or machine name,
there appears to be a size limitation and/or file locking behavior that leads to
lost data, if the query is administered or added to by more than one computer
running Systems Management Server Administrator at the same time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, create or administer large queries only on one
Administrator console at a time.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
