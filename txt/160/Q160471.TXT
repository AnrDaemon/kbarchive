SUMMARY
=======

Chapter 8, page 467, of the Windows NT Server 4.0 Networking Guide, "Managing
Microsoft WINS Servers," contains the following documentation error. The first
paragraph under the section "Backing Up the Database" states the following:

   WINS Manager provides backup tools so that you can back up the WINS database.
   After you specify a backup directory for the database, WINS performs complete
   database backups every "three" hours, by installation default.

This information is also incorrectly documented in the WINS Manager Help in
Windows NT 4.0:

   Specifies the path to the folder where the backup copies of the database are
   to be stored. If you specify a backup path, WINS automatically performs a
   full backup of its database to this folder every 3 hours.

This information is incorrect. After specifying the path, WINS performs a
complete database backup every 24 hours.

The Windows NT Server 3.51 WINS Manager Help and the Resource Kit in Volume II,
"Networking Guide", Chapter 14, "Installing and Configuring WINS Servers", page
298, first paragraph, correctly documents this information.
