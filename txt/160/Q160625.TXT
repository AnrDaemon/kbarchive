SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to dial out using a 32-bit program, you may receive a busy signal
and the following message:

   The line is busy
   Try again later.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your modem is configured to disable Call Waiting when
the Call Waiting service is not active on your phone service.

When Call Waiting is enabled, a prefix is automatically dialed when a 32-bit
program dials out. With Call Waiting no longer available, dialing the prefix
returns a busy signal.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remove the dialing prefix, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

2. Click the modem you are using, and then click Dialing Properties.

3. On the My Locations tab, click the "This location has call waiting. To
   disable it, dial" check box to clear it.

4. Click OK.
