======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the system date in Control Panel Date/Time it may cause a Stop
0A error. This happens when you use the Madge ATM Multiplexor network adapter in
a computer running Windows NT. Note that on some computers this will happen
immediately, on others it may take some time. This may also happen when
performing certain functions under Microsoft SQL Server such as checkdb.

CAUSE
=====

This stop code can be generated by outdated drivers for the Madge ATM
Multiplexor network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact Madge for information and assistance regarding Madge Drivers.
