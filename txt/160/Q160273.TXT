TITLE   :LPR 'o' Option Does Not Work After Applying SP5
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:3.51
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 5 for Windows NT Server 3.51, the TCP/IP printing
service no longer interprets the 'o' option correctly. Prior to the release of
Service Pack 5, a PostScript file sent to the TCP/IP Print Server with the 'o'
option would properly send an already-formatted-as- PostScript file to the
printer without formatting the file. After adding SP5, the same command would
result either in the file printing the PostScript file as text or result in no
output at all.

RFC 1179 states the following:

   7.24 o - Print PostScript output file

   +---+------+----+
   | o | file | LF |
   +---+------+----+
   Command code - 'o'
   Operand - File to print

This command prints the data file to be printed, treating the data as standard
PostScript input.

CAUSE
=====

Changes in Service Pack 5 disabled the functionality of this option.

RESOLUTION
==========

The current workaround, if the 'o' option is needed, is to revert back to the
LPD files prior to Service Pack 5. These files are:

   lpdsvc.dll
   lprhelp.dll
   lprmon.dll

If you need the SP5 files for the added functions they offer, the other
workaround, as specified in

   ARTICLE-ID: Q153666
   TITLE : Updated TCP/IP Printing Components for Windows NT 3.51

is to use the 'l' option, instead, to send a PostScript file to the TCP/IP Print
server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
