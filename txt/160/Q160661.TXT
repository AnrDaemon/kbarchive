SUMMARY
=======

If you run the Japanese Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client on a computer that
is not running Japanese Windows 95, Japanese characters are not displayed
properly. Japanese Microsoft Exchange clients use a double- byte character set
(DBCS), which is not completely supported by non- Japanese versions of Windows
95.
