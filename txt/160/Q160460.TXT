======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you remotely control a computer running Windows 95 that is using Netscape
Navigator 3.0, and the current web page has animated pictures, the Systems
Management Server 1.2 Administrator Tool will generate a general protection
fault (GPF) error when trying to view the animated pictures.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused when a compressed animated bitmap stream is transmitted
to the Systems Management Server Administrator Tool, but the tool cannot
properly handle the stream of animated pictures being updated to it. Static
bitmaps, GIFs and JPGs will display correctly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either use Netscape Navigator 2.0 or Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
