SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to export an individual mailbox's most common
directory attributes to a text file. You cannot use Microsoft Exchange Server to
export the contents of an individual mailbox in a container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To export an individual mailbox's most common directory attributes to a text
file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Mailbox.csv file from the Support\Samples\Csvs\Mailbox folder on the
   Microsoft Exchange Server CD-ROM to the root folder of drive C.

2. Create a new text file called Mailbox.txt in the root folder of drive C that
   contains the following lines:

      [Export]
      DirectoryService=<server1>
      HomeServer=<server2>
      Basepoint=/o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=container/cn=<name>
      ExportObject=Mailbox
      InformationLevel=Full
      RawMode=Yes
      HiddenObjects=Yes
      Subcontainers=Yes

      [Import]
      DirectoryService=<server1>
      Basepoint=/o=ORG/ou=SITE/cn=container
      Container=
      InformationLevel=Full
      OverwriteProperties=Yes
      RawMode=Yes

   where <server1> is the name of the computer on which the directory
   service is running, <server2> is the name of the Microsoft Exchange
   Server computer, and <name> is the mailbox's distinguished name (DN).

3. Type the following command at a command prompt, and then press ENTER:

   c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /e c:\mailbox.csv /o c:\mailbox.txt

NOTE: After you export an individual mailbox's most common directory attributes
to a text file, you can use the following command to import the attributes:

   c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /i c:\mailbox.csv /o c:\mailbox.txt
