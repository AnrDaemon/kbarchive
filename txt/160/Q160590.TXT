TITLE   :XFOR: PCMTA: The Status Could Not Be Logged
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the MSMail Connector message transfer agent (PCMTA) tries to log its
current status to the Event Viewer, it might report the following stop error
message:

   STOP The status could not be logged. Use the Services icon in Control Panel
   to ensure the service is running.

Checking the Services shows the PCMTA services are running, mail is being
transferred, and the expected Microsoft Exchange services are working properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Add the Microsoft Exchange Service Account to the local computer's
Administrators group or the Domain Administrators group as follows:

1. Add the Microsoft Exchange Service Account to the Administrators group using
   the Windows NT User Manager program.

2. In Control Panel Services, stop and restart the PCMTA service(s) that logging
   is being attempted on.

NOTE: This may also require a synchronization of the servers in the domain if
this is a member server and a reboot of the computer running Microsoft Exchange
Server to activate the new access controls for this user account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Log Status button is located within the Configuration/Connections/MS Mail
Connector Properties under the Connector MTAs tab in the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program.
