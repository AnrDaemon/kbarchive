The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator Export function from
the command line, if the Export is missing, only mailboxes will be exported
regardless of the other settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample command line is:

   Admin /e <Export file> /d directory server name /o <options
   file>

Actual Example:

   Admin /e Output.csv /d Myserver /o Export.ini

Example of Export.ini. This will export only custom recipients:

   [Export]
   Basepoint=/o=Microsoft/ou=wonderland/cn=Recipients
   Homeserver=Myserver
   ExportObject=Remote

when you remove the [Export], only mailboxes are exported. This will export only
mailboxes:

   Basepoint=/o=Microsoft/ou=wonderland/cn=Recipients
   Homeserver=Myserver
   ExportObject=Remote
