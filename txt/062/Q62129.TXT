SUMMARY
=======

The following command returns text containing the contents of all fields in the
message specified by type and ID in Microsoft Mail version 2.00:

      msmail (textizeMessage, type, ID) => data

In Mail version 3.00, the additional optional parameter of "folderRef" is added:

      msmail(textizeMessage, type, ID[, folderRef]) => data

"type" is a single message type obtained from a call to getMessageListField. For
example, "Mess" is the message type for "Note" messages.

"ID" is a number that identifies a particular message obtained from a call to
getMessageListField.

"folderRef" is not the same as the folder name. To get the folder reference from
the folder name, use the function GetFolderRef. "folderRef" is only available
with Mail 3.00. If omitted, the operation defaults to the current folder.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
