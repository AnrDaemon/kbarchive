SUMMARY
=======

The following information applies to the Microsoft MS-DOS LAN Manager versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, and 2.2 running under Windows versions 3.0 and 3.1.

The network interface (NIF) is presented to the user upon typing the NET or NET
ADMIN command. This interface allows network access, control, and maintenance.

If MS-DOS LAN Manager's NET.EXE is run full screen inside Windows, an MS-DOS
mouse driver (MOUSE.SYS or MOUSE.COM for the Microsoft mouse) must be run in
order to use a mouse with NET.EXE. However, if Windows is running and ALT+ENTER
is pressed at the full-screen command prompt, thus converting the full-screen
command prompt into a windowed command prompt inside the Windows screen group
(using OS/2 terminology), NET.EXE will work inside the Windows screen group.

However, whether or not an MS-DOS mouse driver is installed, the mouse cannot be
used to access the NET.EXE menus. Instead, use the keyboard accelerators. This
appears to be a mouse contention problem with running a mouse-aware MS-DOS
application in a windowed command prompt inside the Windows screen group. (That
is, no mouse-aware MS-DOS applications can use the mouse when run in this
windowed command prompt; it is not a limitation of NET.EXE.)
