SUMMARY
=======

You can view the Recorder macro events that have been stored in a Recorder macro
file by following these steps:

1. Run Recorder.

2. Open the file with the macro you want to view.

3. Select from the list the specific macro you desire to see if multiple macros
   are on that file.

4. While pressing SHIFT, choose Properties from the Macro menu. This action
   brings up a dialog box that shows all the steps that have been recorded into
   your macro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot use this procedure to edit the macro, but it does allow you to view
the steps that are performed when the macro is run. You cannot record sequences
or execute macros while you are running an MS-DOS-based application. To do any
of the above, you must have Bridge Toolkit version 2.0.

For additional information on Bridge Toolkit, contact Softbridge Microsystems.
