TITLE   :Windows 3.0 Enhanced Mode Hangs at Startup on Super VGA
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows 95.x Retail Product

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 enhanced mode stops responding (hang) during start
up on a 386 machine equipped with a Super VGA adapter. Real and standard modes
(WIN /R and WIN /S) work correctly, and Setup runs properly.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because many Super VGA cards require an EMMExclude=
statement to work properly under Windows version 3.0 enhanced mode. This is
because they use an additional memory area in the adapter segment that is not
detected by Windows.

Adapters that should NOT require an EMMExclude include IBM, Paradise, and Video
Seven.

RESOLUTION
==========

To add this statement, insert the following line under the [386Enh] section of
the SYSTEM.INI file:

      [386Enh]
      EMMExclude=C400-C7FF

If this does not help, extend the exclusion range to CBFF.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Super VGA card is defined as a display card that offers IBM Video Graphics
Array (VGA) compatibility as well as additional proprietary-extended display
modes, such as 800 x 600. Most non-IBM VGA cards sold today have Super VGA
capability.
