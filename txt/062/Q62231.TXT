SUMMARY
=======

If graphics do not appear on a custom form in Microsoft Mail, do the following
when looking at the form in the Form Designer:

1. Make sure the graphic overlay field is covering the whole form.

2. Make sure the graphic overlay is the very topmost item either by adding the
   graphic overlay last or by clicking the overlay field and bringing it to the
   front by pressing COMMAND++ (PLUS key).

   Note: A quick way to make the overlay the topmost item is to set the style of
   the card field "Overlay" to Shadow, select the overlay, and press COMMAND++
   (PLUS key).

3. Make sure the Read, Send, and Edit screens are all compiled.
