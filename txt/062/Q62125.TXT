SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail interface can be used with SuperCard versions 1.0 through 1.5
from Silicon Beach Software. To do this, use the Convert Stack command described
in the SuperCard manual, and pick the default button Normal in the Resource
Preferences dialog box.

The interface consists of an XFCN named "msmail" and a number of STR# resources.
Because SuperCard doesn't import STR# resources, the normal conversion process
automatically adds these strings to SuperCard's SharedFile.

When you create a stand-alone application from SuperEdit, these resources are not
automatically copied in; this is explained in SuperCard Technical Note #1 (which
comes with SuperCard). To make Microsoft Mail work, you must manually copy three
STR# resources from this stack to your stand-alone application using ResEdit.
These resources are called "msmail", "msmailStrings", and "msmailErrors". You
can give the resources any ID, but you must not change the names.

Note: The "msmailErrors" resource is used to set the HyperCard global
mailResultText. If you do not need error strings, you can remove this resource
to save space.

This information is taken from the appendix of the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard
Interface Documentation."
