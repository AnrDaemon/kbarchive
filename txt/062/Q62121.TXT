The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, versions 2.0, 3.0

SUMMARY
=======

The following command logs off from the user's mailbox that was specified in the
last call to logOn:

      msmail(logOff)

After a logOff call, all msmail calls will revert to using the mailbox that the
Mail desk accessory (DA) is logged in to.

If a logOn call has never been made, a logOff call will have no effect.

It is not possible to log off the workstation (DA) session with this call. With
Mail 3.00, you can log off the workstation session by using the function
ChooseServer.

Documentation."
