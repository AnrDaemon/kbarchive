-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following routine retrieves information from a messageList created by
getMessageList or displayMessageCenter in Microsoft Mail version 2.00:

      msmail(GetMessageListField, messageList, fieldName[,index])=>data

What is returned depends on the value of the "fieldName" parameter:

1. "messageCount" returns the number of messages in the list.

2. "type" returns the 4-character message type.

3. "ID" returns the message's unique ID number.

4. "read" returns true if the message has already been read; otherwise, it
   returns false.

5. "enclosure" returns true if the message contains an attached file; otherwise,
   it returns false.

6. "urgent" returns true if the message is urgent; otherwise it returns false.

7. "sender" returns the sender's name.

8. "subject" returns the message subject.

9. "receivedDate" returns the received date in seconds since 1904.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If "index" is supplied, getMessageListField returns the value of that field for
the message indicated by "index." So, to find out whether the third message has
been read, type the following:

   " put msmail(getMessageListField, messageList, "read", 3) into isRead "
   (without the quotation marks)

If "index" is not supplied, getMessageListField returns a list of values, one for
each message in the message list, followed by a return:

   put msmail(getMessageListField, messageList, "sender") into sndr

If the message list has multiple messages in it, "sndr" will contain:

   sender of message 1<return>
   sender of message 2<return>
   ...

If the message list has one message in it, "sndr" will contain:

   sender of message 1<return>

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
