The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With Magic Software's AutoSave version 1.01 enabled, if you are composing a
Microsoft Mail message and your Macintosh receives a Mail message, or a desk
accessory (DA), such as Pyro 4.0, becomes active, or applications are changed
while in MultiFinder, AutoSave 1.01 may send the message automatically and
unexpectedly through Mail.

AutoSave 1.01 automatically generates a COMMAND+S to save documents created
within applications that are included in the Control Panel Exclusive List for
AutoSave. COMMAND+S is also the command to send mail in Microsoft Mail.

Magic Software's AutoSave II can be configured to use a character other than "s"
to save; however, the Exclusive List in the version of AutoSave (1.01) shipped
with Microsoft Office does not include either Microsoft Mail or the DA Handler.
This version of AutoSave, included with Microsoft Office (Microsoft CD-ROM
version 1.01), is a disabled version that will not allow changes to be made to
the Exclusive List other than to delete applications.

To obtain a fully functional version of AutoSave (AutoSave II) in which the DA
Handler and other applications can be added to the Exclusive List, call Magic
Software at (402) 291-0670 or (800) 342-6243 from 10 AM to 6 PM PST.
