TITLE   :FIX: Attempting to Expand a Help Dialog Box in PWB 1.0 May Hang
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities
PROD/VER:MS-DOS:1.0; OS/2:1.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When one of the pull-down menus in the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0
is selected (File, Edit, View, and so on) and then F1 is chosen for help on that
menu, a small help screen appears. If CTRL+F10 is chosen in an attempt to expand
the window to full screen, the machine will hang under DOS. If the machine
doesn't hang, it may require another invocation of CTRL+F10 to cause the
problem.

Under OS/2, the machine may not hang, but the PWB's functionality will be
disrupted and attempts to free oneself may cause a GP-fault. It may be possible
to exit the PWB, but at the very least, the CURRENT.STS file will be corrupted
so that future entrances to PWB will result in very odd window configurations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the PWB version 1.0. This
problem was corrected in PWB version 1.1.
