SUMMARY
=======

To support the "Import network drivers" option of the OS/2 LAN Manager versions
2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, and 2.2 Setup program, you must have a floppy disk with the
following directory setup (it must be exact, or OS/2 LAN Manager will
GP-fault):

   A: ---
        |  (or MSLANMAN.DOS)
        |--MSLANMAN.OS2 --
                         |
                         |--DRIVERS --
                                     |
                                     |--NIF
                                     |--<Your driver name>

Within the \NIF subdirectory, there must be a file for every configuration you
plan to offer the user. Within those files, the following format must be
observed (use the OS/2 UB Drivers disk, UB8.NIF file, as an example):

   Model = <Name to appear as user option>
   Path = <Pathname, in relation to A:\MSLANMAN.OS2\DRIVERS directory
           for location of drivers (for example, UB)>
   DeviceDriver = <Name of DEVICE as it should appear in CONFIG.SYS>000
   DeviceName = <Name of protocol (for example, netbeui$ or ubxns$)>
   Type = <Driver type (for example, MONO - monolithic, NDIS - MAC
           driver)>

All of the files referenced by the .NIF files should be placed within the
"<Your driver name>" subdirectory.

This is the format that should be followed by all third-party driver vendors when
constructing a disk to include with OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0.
