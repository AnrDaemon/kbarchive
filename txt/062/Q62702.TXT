TITLE   :PWB 1.0 Does Not Return from DOS Shell If TMP Contains ";"
PRODUCT :Microsoft Programming Utilities

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, version 1.0 
 - Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If there is a semicolon ";" in your TMP environment variable, you may not be
able to return to the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0 by typing "exit"
(without the quotation marks) after selecting "DOS Shell" from the File menu in
PWB. This situation does not occur with PWB version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Since the TMP environment variable is used to specify a single directory rather
than a path, the semicolon character should not be used.

To re-create this situation, type the following at the command line:

   " set TMP=C:\TMP;" (without the quotation marks)

Then, invoke PWB 1.0 and select DOS Shell from the File menu. Typing "exit"
(without the quotation marks) on the DOS command line will not bring you back
into PWB. To correct the problem, remove the semicolon from the end of the TMP
environment variable.
