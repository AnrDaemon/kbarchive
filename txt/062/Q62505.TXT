TITLE   :Common Mistakes Made when Modifying PROTOCOL.INI
PRODUCT :Microsoft LAN Manager
PROD/VER:
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbnetwork

======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

If you use the defaults when installing OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a,
or 2.2 with an EtherLink II card, the EtherLink II card may use Interrupt 3,
which is the same interrupt that COM2 uses.

If you need to use the COM2 port, edit PROTOCOL.INI to change the interrupt
information; otherwise, there will be a conflict with the EtherLink II card.

Remember to edit the version of PROTOCOL.INI that is in the subdirectory named in
the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file:

   device=c:\lanman\drivers\protman\protman.os2
          /i:c:\lanman\drivers\protman

Edit the copy of PROTOCOL.INI in the subdirectory pointed to by the
/I:C:\LANMAN\DRIVERS\PROTMAN portion of the line listed above, NOT the copy in
C:\LANMAN\DRIVERS\ELNKII.

Finally, remember that you must restart the computer for any changes to
PROTOCOL.INI to take effect.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.0 2.1 2.10 2.10a 2.1a 2.2 2.20
