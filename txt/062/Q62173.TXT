SUMMARY
=======

Because msmail() is a HyperTalk function, it always returns a value.

This holds true even in cases when the effect of the msmail() function, rather
than the result it returns, is the purpose of the msmail() call. For instance,
when using the sendMessage call, the value the msmail() function returns is
unimportant; what is important is the effect: mail is sent over the network to
the server.

In cases like these, the result of the msmail() function must be redirected;
otherwise, HyperCard will put the result into the message box. To keep the
message box from appearing, use the HyperCard "get" command, which will absorb
the result of the function by putting it into the HyperCard global "it". For
example:

   get msmail (sendMessage, myMessage)
