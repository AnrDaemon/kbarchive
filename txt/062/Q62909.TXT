There are three methods to disable QEMM.SYS version 5.0 from loading:

1. Boot clean or from an MS-DOS disk that does not contain QEMM.SYS.

2. Manually remove the device line from the CONFIG.SYS file
   (device=<path>QEMM.SYS [parameters]). This can be done by without
   erasing the user's configuration of QEMM.SYS by placing REM before the
   device= line (this will cause MS-DOS versions earlier than 4.0 to give an

   invalid line in CONFIG.SYS error

   which will cause no harm to your system).

3. Reboot or reset the computer.

   a. After the initial computer beep, press the ALT key.

   b. When the message "QEMM; Press any key to continue. ESC to abort" appears,
      press ESC to disable QEMM.SYS.

The third method also disables any LoadHi commands in the CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
