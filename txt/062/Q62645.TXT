SYMPTOMS
========

On a Toshiba 5200, Microsoft Windows version 3.0 Setup for a standard VGA may
run in real mode and standard mode, but it stops responding (hangs) in enhanced
mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

Setting EMMEXCLUDE=C000-C7FF in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file
enables Windows to run in enhanced mode.

This line is automatically added to the SYSTEM.INI file if you choose "Toshiba
5200" during the initial SETUP or using the maintenance SETUP or Windows SETUP
icon after having installed Windows. This may be easier than manually editing
the SYSTEM.INI.

NOTE: The EMMEXCLUDE statement may solve memory address conflicts on the Toshiba
5200, but removal of TSRs and standard troubleshooting should still be
performed.
