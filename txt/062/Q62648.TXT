======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message occurs in Microsoft Write each time the temporary
file attempts to grow larger than 64K.

   Insufficient memory to complete this operation; save your document, then quit
   to increase available memory

CAUSE
=====

Attempting to Paste an image (captured using Print Screen) more than once may
cause this error message. This is a limitation of Write, not of Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

The only way to recover from this situation is to save the document, exit and
restart Write. Reload the file and attempt the operation again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message received in earlier versions of Microsoft Windows is

   Session too long. Save now, then quit.

The limitation remains the same; the message was changed to try to make the
action more clear.
