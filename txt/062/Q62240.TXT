SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface allows the power of Microsoft Mail to be
used to meet your custom needs.

Since the HyperCard Application Programming Interface (HAPI) makes all of the
functions of Mail fully available for programming and use, there are many
possibilities for streamlining and customizing the use of Mail. Below is a list
of some possible utilities and stacks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Utility or Stack Description
----------------------------

Archive messages        Using the DisplayMessageCenter, a user could
                        pick which messages should be archived. These
                        could be stored in the stack, or saved to a
                        file for importation into a database.

Auto Replies            Similar to the Out of Office stack shipped with
                        the functions. Waits for incoming messages,
                        and auto-replies to the Sender with a preset
                        message, such as "I am gone to xxx, will be
                        back at y:yy."

Anonymous Suggestion
Program                 Logs into a "Suggestion" account and reads
                        each message. Puts the body of each message
                        into the body of a new message and sends the
                        new message to the suggestion reviewer. The
                        original sender is then anonymous to the
                        reviewer.

Garbage Collector       Deletes all read files that are older in days
                        than the number in an "Aged" field.

Space Saver             Downloads and deletes all read messages with
                        enclosures.

Order Automation        Using a custom form, the order taker can fill
                        in the blanks while on the telephone. When the
                        form is completed, the message is automatically
                        sent to the "Order Taker." This stack creates
                        the data document for Word with the address,
                        prints a packing list, sends the accounts
                        payable department a notice of the order, and
                        the warehouse an itemized list of what items to
                        pull from stock. At the end of the day, it
                        totals and prints a report that summarizes the
                        number of orders and gives an inventory update,
                        bookings, the number of labels to print.

Active Bulletin Board
System News Center.     A user can send in a subscription
                        to various topics. When an article is sent,
                        the News Center forwards the message to the
                        people interested in that topic.

Mail Forwarding         When moving a user is moved from one account
                        on one server to a different server, the user
                        could forward all their mail with the touch
                        of a button.

Mail Retrieval          For large networks with multiple servers,
                        a stack could be made in Mail 3.00 that
                        logs into each server as network manager
                        and forwards all mail to one account.

Server Report           The stack reads the server usage report saved
                        in Word format from the Network Administrator
                        and sends a message to all those users that
                        exceed limits in too much space used,
                        old unread messages, or large enclosures,
                        asking them to save and delete the messages.

Tension Relief          Play-By-Mail games. You make a move and the
                        stack sends the move to your opponent. When
                        the opponent has some spare time, she or he
                        can run the stack, which downloads the move,
                        and waits for the opponent to respond. Chess,
                        checkers, and tic-tac-toe are simple
                        possibilities. For use at low-traffic times
                        only.

Training tools          A stack could monitor a student's progress
                        through it and mail the instructor when the
                        student is stuck on the same part for a long
                        time. In addition, the stack could forward
                        completed tests.

Teacher's tools         Upon receipt of test results, it can grade
                        multiple choice tests, compute the class
                        average, and send the results (text and
                        graphs) to the class participants.

Because the HyperCard Application Programming Interface supports virtually all
calls to the Mail server, the possible uses of the SDK for creating utilities
and applications that employ Mail as a communications backbone are almost
unlimited. The above suggestions are only a sample of the possibilities.
