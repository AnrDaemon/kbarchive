SUMMARY
=======

The following command returns a list of user names in Microsoft Mail version
2.00:

   msmail (getUserList [,"local" or "all"] [,searchPattern]
   [,"leading" or "embedded" or "exact"] [,extended]) => userNames

In Mail version 3.00, the second argument is expanded to include "Address" for
addresses from the user's address book.

If "local" is asked for (the default), then only users on the same server will be
returned; if "all" is asked for, the routine returns all users on the network
that can be reached via Microsoft Mail.

An optional "searchPattern" can be passed so that only a subset of users is
returned. This allows you to specify only part of a name.

The following three search modes can be used:

1. "leading" -- will match the searchPattern if it is at the start of a user
   name

2. "embedded" -- all user names containing the pattern anywhere within
   themselves

3. "exact" -- only users whose name exactly matches searchPattern

If "extended" is true (the default), then the name(s) are returned in the form
"userName@serverName".

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
