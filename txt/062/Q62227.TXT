SUMMARY
=======

The following information pertains to the selection of optimum hardware for
running Flight Simulator version 4.00:

A 12 MHz, 80286 computer with 640 RAM and a 16-bit VGA adapter and shadow RAM
(most EGA cards utilize only 8 bits) will allow utilization of the 16-bit bus.
This bus width may improve screen refresh screens by a factor of 4 as compared
to an 8088 system with EGA.

A 16 MHz, 80386 computer is slightly slower than a 20 MHz 80286. Although it is
more expensive, the 80386 will allow for future growth.

On 80386 systems, the CPU clock rate is a significant factor up to about 33 MHz.
Use the medium setting on active scenery. Refresh speed will be improved by
turning off active scenery and random weather on 8088-based systems.

LCD displays generally will refresh at very slow rates. Using a disk cache of 64K
or greater will make scenery switches faster.

A math coprocessor does not improve the performance of Flight Simulator.
