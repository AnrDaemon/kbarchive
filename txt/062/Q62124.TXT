SUMMARY
=======

Many of the Microsoft Mail function calls refer to a "message reference." This
is a number passed back from, for example, the createMessage or readMessage
command. (The number is actually a Macintosh "handle.") This number must be
passed to all commands that will manipulate a message to let the commands know
which message to work on. For example:

      put msmail (createMessage) into myMessage
      put msmail (addSubject, myMessage, "Test")

Any valid HyperCard variable can be used as a message reference. "messageRef" is
used in most examples for continuity.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
