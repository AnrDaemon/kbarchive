SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word, if you use the INDEX field with the \E switch, there is an
upper limit of five contiguous characters that you can use to separate the index
from the page number. The default character is a blank space.

Similarly, if you use the \L switch with the INDEX field to specify a page number
separator, Word imposes a limit of five characters. The default character is a
blank space.

If you specify more than five characters to use with either switch, Word will use
only the first five.

In the following example, periods are used to separate the index from the page
number, and a semicolon separates the page numbers:

{index \E "..." \L ";"}
