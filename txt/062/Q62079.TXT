SUMMARY
=======

The command to initialize memory allocation for a new message is as follows:

      msmail(createMessage [, type]) => messageRef

createMessage allocates and initializes a new and empty message. If successful, a
message reference number is returned. This can be passed to other routines to
manipulate this particular message.

The default message type is "Mess" or the standard Note form. To create other
types of messages, put the correct four-character form ID in the type parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To convert the two-character IDs used by the Microsoft Mail Form Designer to the
four-character IDs used by createMessage, add the characters "Me" to the
beginning of the two-character ID. For example, the Phone message form has the
two-character ID "sp", so to create a Phone message, use the following command:

      put msmail (createMessage, "Mesp") into phoneMessage

"phoneMessage" is any HyperCard container.

For more information on message types, query on "getMessageType" (without the
quotation marks).

Documentation."
