The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To change or adjust a program group (for example, Main) in Microsoft Windows
Program Manager, the group must be minimized in Program Manager's screen as an
icon and selected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For instance, to delete an entire program group, minimize the group, then from
the File menu choose Delete. If the group is not minimized, Program Manager
assumes that you want to delete the active program item in the active group.

The above method also works correctly for the chosen commands in the Properties
option in the File menu.

If, from the File menu, you choose Properties with the program group selected as
described above, you can edit the name or group that is being used.
