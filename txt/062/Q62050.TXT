The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

The following syntax returns the name of the enclosure contained within the
specified message:

      msmail(getEnclosureName, messageRef[,index])=>fileName

If the specified message does not contain an enclosure, an error will be
returned.

"messageRef" is a reference to a selected message obtained by making a call to
the msmail function using a parameter that returns a message reference.

The optional "index" parameter allows multiple enclosures to be extracted from a
message. Since this feature was not implemented in Microsoft Mail version 2.00,
passing anything other than 0 (zero) in Mail 2.00 returns an error (0 is the
default).

Note: This default was changed in Mail version 3.00 to allow multiple enclosures.
With Mail 3.0, any number 1 to n is allowed. 1 is the default with Mail 3.00. If
a script used the optional index with Mail 2.00 and is updated to Mail 3.00, a
"Bad enclosure index" mailresulttext will be returned. The mailresult error is
-2593.

In all cases, the name that the file was successfully saved with is returned.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
