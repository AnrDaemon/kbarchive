The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Most of the files on the Microsoft Windows version 3.0 disks are in a compressed
format. The only way to tell if these files are compressed is to compare the
file sizes in your WINDOWS directory with the file sizes on the disks. The
exception is the *.SYS files, which are marked compressed with a "$" as the last
letter of the file extension. For example, HIMEM.SY$ is the compressed file for
HIMEM.SYS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To expand a single compressed file, use the EXPAND.EXE program. This program is
located on the Windows Disk 2 on both the 1.2MB 5.25-inch and 720K 3.5-inch disk
formats. For example, to expand CALC.EXE to the WINDOWS directory on Drive C, do
the following:

1. Copy EXPAND.EXE from the Windows Setup disk to the WINDOWS directory of your
   hard drive.

2. Switch to the WINDOWS directory on Drive C.

3. Insert the disk with CALC.EXE on it. This is located on Disk 3 of the 1.2MB
   5.25-inch format and Disk 3 of the 720K 3.5-inch format.

4. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

   EXPAND A:\CALC.EX_ C:\WINDOWS\CALC.EXE

If you try to expand a file that is already expanded, you receive the following
message:

   Input file <filename> already in expanded format

where <filename> is the name of the file you attempted to expand.

To expand more than one file at a time, refer to the "Putting Windows on a
Network" Section on Page 553 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
