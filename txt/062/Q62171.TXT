SUMMARY
=======

The following command displays a standard Save As dialog box that prompts the
user for a filename in Microsoft Mail version 2.00:

      msmail(saveMessage, type, ID)

If the user enters a filename and clicks OK, a Microsoft Word text file that
contains the contents of all fields in the message with the given type and ID is
created.

"type" is a single message type obtained from a call to getMessageListField. For
example, "Mess" would be for "Note" messages.

"ID" is a number that identifies a particular message obtained from a call to
getMessageListField.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
