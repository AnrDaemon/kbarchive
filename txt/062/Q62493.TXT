SUMMARY
=======

Although the HyperCard Application Programming Interface (HAPI) supports signing
in [using msmail(logOn)] to a separate account from the Microsoft Mail desk
accessory (DA), there is a known problem with the msmail(displayMessageCenter)
function supporting this scenario.

The function displayMessageCenter will only display a message center showing the
messages for the DA account. In no case will this call show a message center for
a HAPI logged-on account, unless that account is also logged on for the Mail DA.
If no account is logged on in the DA, the function will display an empty message
box.

Despite this evidence, the HAPI does support making use of a separate account for
all other available Mail functions. If use of the Message Center is highly
desirable in a HAPI stack, a HyperCard alert or documentation suggesting that
the user log in to the appropriate account via the DA is suggested.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mail version 2.00. This problem
was corrected in Mail version 3.00.
