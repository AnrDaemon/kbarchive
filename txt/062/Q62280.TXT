SUMMARY
=======

The msmail call "RemoveField" removes the occurrence of the field indicated by
"index" with the given "ident", as follows:

   msmail(RemoveField, messageRef, ident [, index])

"ident" is a 4-character identification for that field.

If no "index" is specified, the first field with the specified "ident" will be
removed. An "index" of negative one (-1) removes all fields with the specified
ident.

Note: In Microsoft Mail version 2.00, the "index" parameter should occur in the
range between 0 and n-1, where "n" is the number of fields. In Mail version
3.00, the parameter should occur in the range from 1 to n.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AddField command can add text to a pre-existing field or create a new
(unseen) field to hold the text. RemoveField clears fields that are defined as
part of the form, and removes fields that were created with AddField. This
function works only on messages that have not been sent.

This information is taken from the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface
Documentation."
