======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Flight Simulator version 4.00 may have as much as a 45 second delay when raising
or lowering the landing gear with the "G" key. This problem occurs on 8088-based
machines with a monochrome display and adapter, and is due to the slower speed
of the 8088 processor.
