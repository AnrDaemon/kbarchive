TITLE   :Unexpected Search Results Using Index Server with Local Web Site
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::2.0,4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbenv

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Index Server to index the content of a local Web site that uses
redirects, you may receive unexpected content if you run a search.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur because all virtual directories are based on a local
physical path when they are initially created. By default, this path is added to
the Web catalog in Index Server. If you change this virtual directory path so
that it includes a redirect, the initial mapping that exists in Index Server is
not removed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue:

1. Start Internet Services Manager.

2. Right-click the virtual directory that you want to change, and then click
   Properties.

3. Click the Home directory tab, and then click "A directory located on this
   computer".

4. Click to clear the "Index this resource" check box, and then click Apply.

5. On the Home directory tab, click "A redirection to a URL", and then click
   Apply.

Content is corrected at the next scheduled index. If you want to immediately
remove the content, delete the contents of the Catalog.wci folder. For
additional information about how to delete the Catalog.wci folder, click the

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot remove the virtual directory by using Index Server Manager. If you do
so, the virtual directory is readded when you restart either the computer or
Internet Information Services (IIS).
