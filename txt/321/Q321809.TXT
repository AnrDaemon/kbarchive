TITLE   :FIX: DB2OLEDB Insert Fails If DBCS Second Byte Is EBCDIC 0x7D
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbbuglist kbfixlist

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an insert of double-byte character set (DBCS) characters where
the second byte is an EBCDIC 0x7D, and you use the Host Integration Server OLE
DB Provider for DB2 driver, you may receive the following error message:

   "SQLSTATE:42601 SQLCODE -104"

This error code description indicates that an illegal symbol was encountered in
an SQL statement.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Integration Server 2000 OLE DB Provider for DB2 incorrectly sent a
single-byte stream, which caused the code to incorrectly interpret the 0x7D
(part of the double-byte character) as a quotation mark.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
