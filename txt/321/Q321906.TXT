TITLE   :FIX: OLE DB Provider Does Not Return Result Sets for Stored Proc
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbhis2000 kbhis2000bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The OLE DB provider for DB2, which is included with Host Integration Server
2000, supports calls to DB2 stored procedures. However, the OLE DB provider for
DB2 does not support the return of single or multiple result sets when calling
stored procedures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OLE DB provider for DB2 has been updated to support the return of single
result sets when calling DB2 stored procedures. The return of multiple result
sets is not yet supported.

Additionally, the following is a list of some other limitations of using the OLE
DB provider for DB2 to call stored procedures:

 - Binding output parameters of type REAL or DOUBLE is not supported.
 - Calling stored procedures when the parameter values contain CHAR Mixed or
   GRAPHIC (DBCS) data types is not supported.
 - Calling a non-existent procedure causes an error.

These are listed in the Host Integration Server 2000 Online Developer's Guide.

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now available
from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior that is described
in this article. Apply it only to systems that specifically need it. This
feature may receive additional testing. Therefore, if your system is not
severely affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that
contains this feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
