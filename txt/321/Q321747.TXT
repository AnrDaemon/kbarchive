======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Dungeon Siege, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you start Dungeon Siege, the screen resolution and color depth are set
according to the capability of your system. You can change the screen resolution
and color depth in the Options Menu dialog box, but some resolutions may not be
available. This article explains how to set the resolution and color depth to
other settings so that every time that you start Dungeon Siege, the game uses
those settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can set the screen resolution and color depth as part of the command line
property in either the desktop icon or Start menu program item. Those settings
are

 - width=<x>

 - height=<y>

 - bpp=<z>

where <x> and <y> are screen resolution dimensions, and <z> is
either 16 for 16-bit color depth or 32 for 32-bit color depth. The standard and
supported settings for screen resolution are:

 - 640 width by 480 height

 - 800 width by 600 height

 - 1024 width by 768 height

NOTE: Resolutions other then these are not supported by Microsoft.

If you do not specify a setting, Dungeon Siege uses the default setting of the
highest resolution or color depth that is supported by your computer. For
example, if 640 x 480 in 16-bit color depth is your computer's highest default
resolution and color depth, and you specify a width of 800 but do not specify
other settings, Dungeon Siege starts in 800 x 480 resolution with 16-bit color
depth.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

How to Specify Settings for the Desktop Icon
--------------------------------------------

1. On the desktop, right-click the Dungeon Siege icon, and then click
   Properties.

2. In the Target box, click to the right of the closing quotation mark, type a
   space, and then add the settings as explained earlier. For example, the
   following command line specifies 640 x 480 resolution with 32-bit color:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege\DungeonSiege.exe" width=640
   height=480 bpp=32 (with the quotation marks)

3. Click OK.

How to Specify Settings for the Start Menu Program Item
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click "Taskbar and Start Menu".

2. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Advanced.

3. In the Start Menu window, locate Start Menu\Programs\Dungeon Siege,
   right-click Dungeon Siege, and then click Properties.

4. In the Target box, click to the right of the closing quotation mark, type a
   space, and then add the settings as explained earlier.

   For example, the following settings would specify 800 x 600 resolution with
   16-bit color:

   "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Dungeon Siege\DungeonSiege.exe" width=800
   height=600 bpp=16 (with the quotation marks)

5. Click OK, close the Start Menu window, and then click OK.
