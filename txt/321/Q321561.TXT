TITLE   :Phantom Connection Count When Keep-Alive Conns Switch HostHeader
PRODUCT :Internet Information Server
PROD/VER::4.0,5.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbCOMIS kbWin2000sp3fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the fix from the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article

   Q319733 MS02-018: April 2002 Cumulative Patch for Internet Information
   Services

a Web site may return the following error message:

   HTTP 403.9: Access Forbidden

CAUSE
=====

If a single site is mapped to multiple Domain Name System (DNS) names and
multiple users switch between different DNS names in that site, the connection
count is distorted when a keep-alive connection connects to different host
headers that are mapped to a single site. A phantom connection count is
enumerated each time a connection switches host headers.

==========
