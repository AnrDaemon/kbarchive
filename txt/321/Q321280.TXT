TITLE   :SMS: Installer "Parse String" Action Leaves Undeclared String
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbtool

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the wizard creates SMS Installer code, or if you create code by using the
Parse String action, you can parse a string and split it into separate
variables. However, in SMS Installer version 2.0.148, if you parse a string into
a single string, the rest of the string is allocated to a null variable (%%).
Therefore, if you want to display a dialog box that contains a percent character
(%), which requires using double percent characters (%%), you get the remainder
of the parsed string instead of a percent character.

This works as expected in earlier versions of SMS Installer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, declare the rest of the string in the second
variable of the Parse String action.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SMS Installer 2.0.148.
