SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to limit the computer resources that are
used by the Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 or Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 services that are running on a Web server.

Limit Computer Resources in IIS 4.0
-----------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, click
   Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
   Manager.

2. When the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) window opens, expand <Server
   Name>, and then click to select either Default Web Site or the name of the
   Web site that you want to work with.

3. Right-click the Web site, and then click Properties.

4. In the Web Site Properties window, click the Performance tab.

5. On this tab, you can select the estimated hits per day for this Web site by
   selecting one of the three predetermined stop positions with the slide bar.
   Adjust this setting to the number of daily connections that you anticipate
   for your site. If the number is set a little higher than the actual number of
   connections, the connections are made faster and server performance is
   improved. If the number is much higher than the actual connection attempts,
   server memory is wasted, reducing overall server performance.

6. You can also click to select Enable Bandwidth Throttling. Turn on this option
   to limit the bandwidth that this Web site uses. For this Web site only, the
   value that you type for the bandwidth overrides the value that is set at the
   computer level, even if this value is greater than the value that is set at
   the computer level.

Limit Computer Resources in IIS 5.0
-----------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Administrative Tools, and then click
   Internet Services Manager.

2. When the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) window opens, expand <Server
   Name>, and then click to select either Default Web Site or the name of the
   Web site that you want to work with.

3. Right-click the Web site, and then click Properties.

4. In the Web Site Properties window, click the Performance tab.

5. On this tab, you can select the estimated hits per day for this Web site by
   selecting one of the three predetermined stop positions with the slide bar.
   Adjust this setting to the number of daily connections that you anticipate
   for your site. If the number is set a little higher than the actual number of
   connections, the connections are made faster and server performance is
   improved. If the number is much higher than the actual connection attempts,
   server memory is wasted, reducing overall server performance.

6. If you want to, click to select Enable Bandwidth Throttling. Turn on this
   option to limit the bandwidth that this Web site uses. For this Web site
   only, the value that you type for the bandwidth overrides the value that is
   set at the computer level, even if this value is greater than the value that
   is set at the computer level.

7. If you want to, click to select Enable Process Throttling. Turn on this
   option to limit the percentage of CPU processing time that this Web site can
   use for out-of-process applications. If this option is turned on, but Enforce
   limits is not selected, the only result is that an event is written to Event
   Log when the assigned limit is exceeded. Click to select Enforce limits to
   incur consequences for overrunning the limit.
