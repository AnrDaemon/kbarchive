TITLE   :ODBC Call Fail on SQL Query with Parameter Markers in Subquery

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 2.65, 2.65.0212, 2000.80.194, 3.0, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

ODBC application programming interface (API) calls such as SQLDescribeCol,
SQLDescribeParam, and SQLNumResultCols, that retrieve meta data, fail when an
application tries to use the calls with Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server on
parameters that are part of the subqueries.

CAUSE
=====

The driver does not retrieve information for parameters that are not bound in
subqueries.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SQLNumResultCols returns an incorrect column count, and SQLDescribeCol returns
an error similar to the following:

   [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Prepared statement is not a
   cursor-specification

If the parameters have been bound by the application through the SQLBindParameter
API, the driver uses that information and the meta data calls do not fail.

To reproduce this behavior from the ODBC Test tool, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the NorthWind database in SQL Server.

2. Call SQLPrepare on the following line of code:

   select T1.EmployeeID as c1 from (select * from EMPLOYEES where EMPLOYEES.EmployeeID   = ?) T1

Note that SQLNumResultCols returns 0 instead of 1. If SQLBindParameter was called
before SQLNumResultCols, the correct column count is retrieved.
