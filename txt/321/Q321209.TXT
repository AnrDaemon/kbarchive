TITLE   :PRB: Start Menu Hangs When You Install File-Monitoring Utilities
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0 SP6
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbIFS kbDSupport kbGrpDSNTDDK

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install certain file-monitoring utilities, such as antivirus software,
on a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6)-based computer, the Start menu may stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The Start menu includes link files (.lnk) that act as shortcuts to programs.
Some file-scanning programs may try to set the Last Access Time (LAT) of those
.lnk files, which causes the Start menu to stop responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, turn off .lnk file scanning in the program or utility in
question, if possible. Or, you can disable the LAT feature. If these workarounds
are not suitable, consider upgrading to a later version of Microsoft Windows
because this behavior is probably caused by a limitation in Windows NT 4.0.

STATUS
======

This is a known issue.
