require you to reinstall any product that uses the metabase. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from incorrectly editing the metabase can be

3. Click the Home Directory tab, and then click the Configuration command
   button.

   Mappings list, and then click Remove.

5. Select the .plx extension, and then click Remove.

6. Click OK twice to close the dialog boxes.

7. Recycle the IISADMIN service, to make sure that the changes are immediately
   written to the metabase.

8. Quit the Internet Service Manager.
