TITLE   :SMSINST: Installer v2.0.148.00 repackage changes registry entry
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug smsinst

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer version 2.0.148.00 repackage changes
registry entry from "%1" to <SystemRoot>. This may prevent software from
running.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, put a "dummy" variable name in the second variable
of the Parse String script item.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you repackage, compile, and run a program with SMS Installer 2.0148.00, a
registry entry value (the registry path may vary from one program to another)
under HKEY_CLASS_ROOT\APP.Document\shell\open\command (or DDEEXEC) changes from
"%1" to "\WINNT". After this registry entry is changed, running a program file
from anywhere on the computer displays the following error message:

   There was an error opening this document. The file does not exist.

This problem occurs in the Parse String script item, which is part of the default
script that is created when you use Installation Expert. The string that is
parsed is the WIN variable. This is typically similar to C:\WINNT. The line is
split at the colon (:); the first part of the string (such as C) is placed in
the SYSDRIVE variable. Because there is no variable defined for the second part
of the string, it should be discarded, but Installer creates a NULL variable
that is equal to WINNT. Therefore, if %% is used later in the script to
reference the percent (%) sign, the NULL variable is references instead. Because
the NULL variable has been set to WINNT in the Parse String script item, %% is
evaluated as WINNT.
