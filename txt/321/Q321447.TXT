SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a shared resource on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Terminal Server, you may receive the following error message:

   No more connections can be made to this remote computer at this time, because
   there are already as many connections as the computer can accept.

When you view the Application Log in the Event Viewer, you may notice the
following logged event:

   

   Date:     <date>          Event ID: 201
   Time:     <time>          Source:   LicenseService 
   User:     N/A             Type:     Error
   Computer: <ServerName>    Category: None

   Description:
   No license was available for user Domain\User using product SMBServer 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server is configured to
use "Per Server" licensing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the Windows NT licensing mode to "Per Seat", and
then restart the computer. To do this, follow these steps.

WARNING: Before you change the licensing mode on the server, review your license
agreement to make sure that you have the correct number of seats, and the
correct type of licenses. If you are not sure of your license requirements,
please contact Microsoft. For more information, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/Default.asp

1. Start License Manager. To do this, click Start, point to Programs, point to
   Administrative Tools (Common), and then click License Manager.

2. Click the Server Browser tab, expand the domain, and then expand the server
   that you want.

3. Double-click the Windows product that you want.

4. In the Choose Licensing Mode dialog box that appears, click Per Seat. You
   receive the following message:

   Changing the license mode to Per Seat will result in current Per Server
   license loss. Press F1 for more help.

   Are you sure you wish to make this change?

5. Click Yes, and then click OK.

6. Read the Client Access License message that appears, click the "I agree that"
   check box, and then click OK.

7. When you finish configuring Per Seat licensing, restart the computer.
