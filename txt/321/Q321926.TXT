TITLE   :Security Override Fails If UserID or Password Is Longer than 10
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) applications that use the explicit security
override feature to supply a userID and a password to COMTI generate the
following error message when a userID or a password that is longer than 10
characters is submitted.

   HRESULT=0x800706BE
   Automation error. The remote procedure call failed.

CAUSE
=====

The internal buffer sizes that COMTI uses for userID and password are limited to
10 bytes. However, there is no automatic test to make sure that this character
length is not exceeded.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

You can turn on a COMTI trace by using Tracebits.exe.

If the userID is longer than 10 characters, the last 2 lines of the COMTI
Tracebits log file look similar to the following:

3528 000009d8 Apr 29 12:18:45.008	14040	LU 6.2 Transport Connect explicit security callback succeeded.
3528 000009d8 Apr 29 12:18:45.008	14040	LU 6.2 Transport Connect got userid.

If the password is longer than 10 characters, the last 3 lines of the COMTI
Tracebits log file look similar to the following:

1656 00000a14 Apr 29 12:25:19.477	14040	LU 6.2 Transport Connect explicit security callback succeeded.
1656 00000a14 Apr 29 12:25:19.477	14040	LU 6.2 Transport Connect got userid.
