TITLE   :COMTI Stops Responding on Second Call with Event 102
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:Kbhostintegserv2000

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) method call works one time, and none of the
following calls succeeds until the Component Services application package shuts
down. Each time that a call is unsuccessful, Component Services posts a COMTI
Event 102 in the application event log with the following details:

   Exception description: (1304) COM Transaction Integrator was unable to
   process the method because the Transaction Server is in the process of
   stopping. Retry the operation later.

NOTE: The Component Services application package can shut down in one of the
following ways:

 - Automatically: if the "Minutes until idle shutdown" option is set. (The
   default setting is three minutes.)
 - Manually: when you open the Component Services manager, right-click the
   Application Package, and then click Shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you apply COM+ Hotfix Rollup Package 19 or later and if
you use COMTI with SNA Server 4.0 and Host Integration Server 2000.
