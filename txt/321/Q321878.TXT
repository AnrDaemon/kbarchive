   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Host Account Cache (HAC) service may fail to start when you restart the
computer the service is installed on.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) may not be fully initialized when the SNA Host
Account Cache service tries to start after a computer restart. The SNA Host
Account Cache service requires MSDE to be fully initialized before the service
can start and connect to the Host Account Cache database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Manually start the SNA Host Account Cache service after you restart the computer
and MSDE is fully initialized.

WORKAROUND
==========

Update the following registry entry to make the SNA Host Account Cache service
dependent upon MSDE.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the DependOnService value under the following key in the registry:

   

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaDatabase

3. On the Edit menu, click Multi String, type "MSSQL$MS_HI_Server_DB" (without
   the quotation marks), and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

Note: Before you add the MSSQL$MS_HI_Server_DB entry in the Multi-String Editor,
you must make sure that the insertion point is at the end of the list of
existing dependencies. Additionally, make sure that the existing dependencies
are not selected before you add the new dependency.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.
