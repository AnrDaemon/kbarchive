SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to change the IISReset timeout value to
wait longer than the default time to reset Internet Information Services (IIS).

Change the IISReset Timeout Value
---------------------------------

1. On the Web server, open a command prompt. To do this, click Start, click Run,
   type "CMD" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. At the command prompt, type "IISRESET /TIMEOUT:<val>" (without the
   quotation marks), where <val> is a numeric value that is measured in
   seconds.

The following screen shot from the command prompt provides more information:

   /TIMEOUT:val        Specify the timeout value (in seconds) to wait for
                       a successful stop of Internet services. On expiration
                       of this timeout the computer can be rebooted if
                       the /REBOOTONERROR parameter is specified.
                       The default value is 20s for restart, 60s for stop,
                       and 0s for reboot.

An example of what you can expect to see in the command prompt window is as
follows:

   C:\>iisreset /timeout:45

   Attempting stop...
   Internet services successfully stopped
   Attempting start...
   Internet services successfully restarted

   C:\>

NOTE: To view a complete listing of the parameters that can be used with
IISReset, type "IISRESET /?" (without the quotation marks) at the command
prompt.

3. Type "Exit" (without the quotation marks) to close the command prompt window.
