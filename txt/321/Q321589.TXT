SYMPTOMS
========

If you use multiple named pipes on a multiprocessor computer to connect to
another server, performance may be reduced.

CAUSE
=====

The redirector (Rdr.sys) creates worker threads if there are many requests.
However, on multiprocessor servers, the worker threads may not be counted
correctly.
