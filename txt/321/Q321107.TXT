PRODUCT :Microsoft SourceSafe
PROD/VER::
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
 - Microsoft Visual C#.NET (2002) 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic.NET (2002) 
 - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The source control integration menus are not available in the stand-alone
editions of Visual C# .NET, Visual Basic .NET, or Visual C++ .NET.

CAUSE
=====

To use the source control integration with the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
languages, you must have the full version of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
Professional, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Developer, or Microsoft
Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Architect. The Visual Studio .NET development
suite provides built-in support for source control operations in the development
environment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use version control with these products, you must use Visual SourceSafe
Explorer to add your projects to source control and to perform source control
commands such as Checkin and Checkout.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
