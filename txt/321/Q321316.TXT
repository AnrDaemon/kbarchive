The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Software Development Kit, used with:
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows XP

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) on a new (or "clean")
installation of Windows XP to turn on Domain Name System (DNS), calling the
EnableDNS method of the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration class may generate
return code 94 ("Path, file, or object not found").

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the Windows XP-based computer does not contain a
NetCfgInstanceId string value under the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}\0000

If this string value does not exist, the EnableDNS method stops processing
prematurely.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, create a NetCfgInstanceID string value under the
registry key that is mentioned earlier in this article. You can leave the data
value of the new string value blank, or set it to any value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows XP.
