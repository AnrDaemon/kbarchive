TITLE   :SMS: Only Principal Site Creates an Advertisement for Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsms200 kbsms200bug

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you assign a Systems Management Server (SMS) client computer to multiple
sites, issues may occur if sites other than the principal site try to target the
client for a software distribution job. The principal site is the site that
appears at the top of the list in the Systems Management tool in Control Panel.
Additionally, the following messages may be logged in Offermgr.log on any other
site server that creates an advertisement for the client:

   Offermgr.log:
   Updated offer VA120001 in the offer info inbox.
   Sent offer VA120001 to all child sites.
   Package VA100002 is on at least one distribution point, it's ready to be
   offered
   CCollectionSource_SQL::CreatePrivateCopy - Inserted table
   _CPY_OfferManagerTemp_16 with 4 rows.
   Did not find previously saved membership list for collection VA100010, enum
   the membership list directly.
   Found 4 members for collection VA100010
   Resource IDS02205 is not from the current site, it won't get any offers.
   Resource IDS22081 is not from the current site, it won't get any offers.
   Resource IDSRMS2 is not from the current site, it won't get any offers.
   Resource IDSRMS1 is not from the current site, it won't get any offers.
   Flushed the offer info cache data to disk.Successfully created private
   membership list for collection VA100010

In this message, the package identifier (ID) is VA100002, the advertisement ID is
VA120001, and the collection that is targeted in the advertisement is VA100010.

CAUSE
=====

When the Offer Manager component creates or updates the advertisement for a
client, it checks the assignment state of each client that is targeted in the
advertisement. If the client is assigned to multiple sites, only the principal
site successfully creates an advertisement. All other sites that the client is
assigned to generate the message that is described in the "Symptoms" section of
this article in Offermgr.log. This message is not an error message; it is an
informational message.

WORKAROUND
==========

A workaround does not exist for this issue. The client only receives software
distribution jobs from the principal site to which it is assigned.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is from Chapter 12 of the SMS Administrators Guide:

   SMS 2.0 allows clients to belong to more than one site (for more information,
   see "Site Assignment" in Chapter 9, "Discovering Resources and Installing
   Clients"). If a client belongs to more than one site, the client receives
   advertisements from each of the sites. When a client runs an advertised
   program, it connects only to the CAP and distribution point of the site
   advertising the program. Status messages for that advertisement are sent only
   to the advertising site.

The client receive advertisements from multiple sites, but only the principal
site successfully creates an advertisement for the client. To create an
advertisement for a client that is in multiple sites, you must change the site
order in the Systems Management tool in Control Panel so that the site that you
want to create the advertisement is listed at the top of the list.
