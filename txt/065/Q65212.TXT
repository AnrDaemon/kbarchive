SUMMARY
=======

One of the aspects of designing a Microsoft Mail form using the Form Designer is
creating an icon for the form.

When compiling a Mail form, the Form Designer reads the screen bitmap directly
from the corresponding screen coordinates. If the tool palette, for example,
overlaps a portion of the icon, that portion of the icon will contain the bitmap
for the tool palette. This results in a garbled icon.

To prevent this problem from occurring, do not superimpose other screen objects
on the icon when compiling a form.
