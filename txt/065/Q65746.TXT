======================================================================
SUMMARY
=======

Remote control programs, such as Carbon Copy Plus and PC Anywhere, do not
function properly with Microsoft Flight Simulator. Usually the computer will
hang, requiring you to reboot or turn the computer off and on to regain control
of the computer.

Microsoft did not test remote control programs with Flight Simulator, and
therefore, cannot guarantee results with these programs.
