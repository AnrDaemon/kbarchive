SUMMARY
=======

To set the COMMAND key equivalent of an object in Microsoft Mail Form Designer
(for example, the COMMAND key equivalent COMMAND+S for the Save button), you can
use the Form Designer globals: objKeyEquiv, cmdKey, and enterKey. It is
recommended, however, to use the special utility function setKeyEquiv instead.
This function was designed solely for setting COMMAND key equivalents and
guarantees the best results.

For example, the following script sets the key equivalent of the selected object
to COMMAND+A:

      on compile
         setKeyEquiv "A" (type the quotation marks)
      end compile

The following script sets the key equivalent of the selected object to RETURN or
ENTER. (If the object is a button, it will set that button to be the default
button.)

      on compile
         setKeyEquiv return
      end compile

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the above examples, the object is assumed to be a button, although the same
syntax applies to fields. Setting COMMAND key equivalents for fields, however,
is unconventional and is not recommended.

To edit object scripts in the Form Designer, the userLevel must be changed. For
more information on this procedure, query on the following words:

   edit and object and script
