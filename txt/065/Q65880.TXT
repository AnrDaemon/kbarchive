Many applications that employ the Windows multiple document interface (MDI)
provide information to the user through the use of a status bar at the bottom of
the application. Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows are two examples
of applications that provide this context-sensitive assistance.

To create a status bar at the bottom of an MDI frame window, do the following:

1. Create an appropriately sized child of the frame window to display the status
   information.

2. Size the MDI client window so that it does not obscure the status window.

When the frame window changes size, it is necessary to size the MDI client and
status windows so that the status bar will remain visible.
