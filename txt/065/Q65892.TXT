The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

If you are using the optional 101-key, plug-in keyboard on a COMPAQ SLT/286 with
Microsoft Windows version 3.0, choose "PC-XT type 84 key" keyboard when
installing Windows. This keyboard does not function properly if Windows is
installed for a 101-key keyboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even with the 101-key keyboard plugged into the SLT/286, the keyboard controller
chip is still set up for an 84-key keyboard. This controller is not capable of
using the codes for an actual 101-key keyboard. The extended keyboard keys, such
as F11, F12, and the CTRL+arrow keys sequence, cannot be used with the 101-key
keyboard on a COMPAQ SLT/286.
