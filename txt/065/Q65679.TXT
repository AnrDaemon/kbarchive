SUMMARY
=======

If you run more than one instance of the same MS-DOS-based program at a time
under Microsoft Windows version 3.0, Windows can identify the different
instances with a number of dots. For example, the MS-DOS Prompt is normally
labeled "COMMAND." under its icon when minimized. The second MS-DOS Prompt will
be labeled "COMMAND.." under its icon. The third will be labeled as "COMMAND..."
under its icon.

The information in this article applies to Windows 3.0 and 3.0a; it does not
apply to later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use ALT+TAB to switch between programs, the different number of dots
will display at the top of the screen with the program name. This feature can be
used to identify which of several different, otherwise identical programs is
currently selected without actually entering the program instance.
