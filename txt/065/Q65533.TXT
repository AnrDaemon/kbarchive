SUMMARY
=======

The following is an explanation of how fault-tolerance drives are numbered.

The first logical drive in each primary partition on each drive is lettered
consecutively (that is, C on Disk 0, D on Disk 1, E on Disk 2, etc.). The
remaining drives are lettered successively on a per-drive basis. For example:

      DISK  80h          DISK  81h
   +-------------+    +-------------+
   | DRIVE  C    |    | DRIVE ??    |  <-- Primary partition if one
   | 80 MB       |    |             |      exists on the second drive.
   +-------------+    +-------------+
   | DRIVE ?     |    | MIRROR OF   |
   |             |    |  DRIVE ?    |  <-- Extended partition that the
   | 245 MB      | ==>|             |      mirrors are created in.
   |             |    |  245 MB     |
   |             |    |             |
   |             |    |             |
   +-------------+    +-------------+
