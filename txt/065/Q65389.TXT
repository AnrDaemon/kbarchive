SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail Gateway Installer may hang a Macintosh Plus during the
installation of a gateway if the Macintosh is an AppleShare workstation and if
it has the older version of the Macintosh ROM. This is a result of a conflict
between the Gateway Installer, AppleShare, and the older ROMs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A possible solution to the problem is to remove the AppleShare and AppleShare
Prep files from the System Folder and restart the Macintosh. The AppleShare
files can be moved back into the System Folder after the installation of the
Gateway.

There are three versions of the Macintosh Plus ROM. To check which version of the
ROM is being used:

1. Enter the debugger by pressing the interrupt switch on the side of the
   computer.

2. Type in "dm 400000" (without the quotation marks) without quotation marks.

3. Check the first eight numbers listed and compare them to the following:

   a. The older version is checksum 4d 1e ea e1 (these ROMs are called "lonely
      heifers").

   b. The newer version is checksum 4d 1f 81 72 (these ROMs are called "loud
      harmonicas").

If the problem is caused by an older ROM, install the Gateway on another
computer. Copy the installed files to the original Macintosh Plus.
