TITLE   :PRB: C Pragma Comment & #ident Strings Missing from Executable
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kb16bitonly

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After compiling an application developed for Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 from
code that uses the comment pragma feature or the #ident preprocessor directive
of the Microsoft C Compiler, the comment string is missing from the final
executable file.

CAUSE
=====

The Resource Compiler in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) version 3.0
or 3.1 removes the comment string from the executable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Declare the comment as a static string variable, as follows:

      static char CommentString[] = _FILE_" = $Revision:   1.2   $";

This will embed the desired information in the .EXE file; however, when the
program is run, the application will load the string with the program's other
variables. This will take up some storage in the local data space.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is an unavoidable consequence of the method the Microsoft C
compiler uses to store comment strings in an executable file. Placing the
strings outside all segments is not consistent with the Windows segment-
executable format, which places all code and data into segments that can be
loaded separately. The Resource Compiler cannot preserve comment data stored
outside any segment.
