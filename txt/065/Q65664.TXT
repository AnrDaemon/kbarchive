SUMMARY
=======

The new CAPTURE.EXE file shipped with the MS-DOS Windows SHELL Kit version 3.01
or later is known to cause extreme delays and corrupted print jobs when it is
used with a Novell 2.12 dedicated or non-dedicated server.

If you experience printing problems when you use Novell NetWare version 2.12 with
Microsoft Windows version 3.00, you may need to replace the CAPTURE.EXE file.
The CAPTURE.EXE file shipped with the MS-DOS Windows SHELL Kit version 3.01 or
later should be replaced with the CAPTURE.EXE shipped with Novell NetWare
version 2.12. The CAPTURE.EXE file is normally located in the Z:\PUBLIC
directory.
