SUMMARY
=======

You cannot create a custom voice Mail form with the Microsoft Mail Form
Designer. A voice Mail form needs special resources in order to function. The
Form Designer currently does not support the installation of voice Mail
resources on a customized Mail form.

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.
