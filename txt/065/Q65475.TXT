SUMMARY
=======

Question:

I accidentally installed local and user-level security on my server. I only
wanted to have share-level security installed. How do I remove local and
user-level security?

Response:

Using the Setup program, perform the following steps to first remove local
security, and then remove user-level security:

1. Log on under local security with a NET LOGON command as "admin", with a
   password of "password" (or whatever you may have changed it to).

2. Run the Setup program in the LANMAN directory and turn the local security
   option off.

3. Shut down OS/2 and reboot the computer.

4. Log onto the network using a NET LOGON command as "admin", with a password of
   "password" (or whatever you may have changed it to).

5. Stop all LAN Manager services with a NET STOP RDR command.

6. Run the Setup program in the LANMAN directory and change from user-level to
   share-level security.

7. Start the server with a NET START SERVER command.

You should now be running only share-level security.
