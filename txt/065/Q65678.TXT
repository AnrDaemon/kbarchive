SUMMARY
=======

The easiest way to access the WordPerfect 5.1 tutorial from Microsoft Windows
version 3.0 is to create an icon that executes a batch file to the tutorial
files. You need to know where the WP.EXE file is located on your hard drive and
where the tutorial files have been placed to create this batch file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of a batch file for the most common configuration:

   cd\
   cd\wp51
   cd learn
   path=C:\wp51
   tutor

Note that it doesn't matter what you name this file, nor where you save the file,
as long as you save it with a ".BAT" extension.

The next step is to create an icon to access the batch file. The following steps
show how to create an icon:

1. Select the group where you want to place the icon.

2. From the File menu of Program Manager, choose New.

3. Select Program Item, then choose OK.

4. For the description, type "WP TUTORIAL" (without the quotation marks).

5. On the command line, put C:\WP51\TUTOR.BAT (which indicates where you placed
   the newly created batch file).

6. Choose OK.

7. You will now have an icon for the WordPerfect Tutorial.
