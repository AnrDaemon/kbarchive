The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Mail server beeps twice when the server INIT loads on
start-up if the "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file is in the System
Folder.

This "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file was used with Microsoft Mail
versions 1.36 and 1.37 to provide compatibility with System 6.0. This
patch is not needed with newer versions of Mail.

To eliminate the beeping, drag the "Microsoft Mail Server Patch" file
into the Trash and restart the Mail server.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
