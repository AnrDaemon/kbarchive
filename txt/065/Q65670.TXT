SUMMARY
=======

It's possible to avoid low-resource problems in Microsoft Windows version 3.0 by
altering the number of Program Groups contained in Program Manager. A convenient
way of doing this is by using multiple PROGMAN.INI files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Program Manager uses the PROGMAN.INI file to determine the groups it can use
when it is running. If you run Windows sessions in which you will not be using
programs in some groups, you can create separate PROGMAN.INI files for those
sessions in which the unused group will not appear and save on system
resources.

For example, if you have several applications that were written for previous
versions of Windows, you must run them in real mode. When running in 386
enhanced mode, these applications need not be present in Program Manager. To
open Windows with only the necessary groups in Program Manager, do the
following:

1. In Program manager, create a group called Old Windows Application, which
   contains these applications.

2. Open Notepad.

3. From the File menu, choose Open.

4. Type "PROGMAN.INI" (without the quotation marks).

5. From the File menu, choose Save As.

6. Type "PROGMAN.REL" (without the quotation marks), then choose OK (this will
   be the PROGMAN.INI file for real mode).

7. While still in Notepad, delete the line that refers to the Old Windows
   Applications group ("GROUP#=C:\WINDOWS\OLDWINDO.GRP" (without the quotation
   marks)).

8. From the File menu, choose Save As.

9. Type "PROGMAN.ENH" (without the quotation marks) then choose OK. (This will
   be the PROGMAN.INI file for 386 enhanced mode.)

10. From the File menu, choose New (to create a batch file for the real-mode
   PROGMAN.INI).

11. Enter the following lines (substitute the correct path):

          COPY C:\WINDOWS\PROGMAN.REL C:\WINDOWS\PROGMAN.INI
          WIN /R

12. From the File menu, choose Save As.

13. Type "RWIN.BAT" (without the quotation marks) and choose OK.

14. From the File menu, choose New (to create a batch file for the enhanced mode
   PROGMAN.INI).

15. Still in Notepad, alter the lines to read as follows:

          COPY C:\WINDOWS\PROGMAN.ENH C:\WINDOWS\PROGMAN.INI
          WIN /3

16. From the File menu, choose Save As.

17. Type "EWIN.BAT" (without the quotation marks) and choose OK.

18. Exit Notepad and exit Windows.

To start Windows in real mode, type "RWIN", then press ENTER at the MS-DOS
prompt. To start in enhanced mode, type "EWIN", then press ENTER at the MS-DOS
prompt. This will start Windows in the appropriate mode with the correct Program
Groups.
