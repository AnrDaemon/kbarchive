 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

The Everex EV-673 EGA/VGA display card requires a special VDD (virtual display
driver) to operate correctly under Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode. You do not need
the special driver for real or standard mode.

This Everex driver is named 673WIN3.EXE, and has a file size of 54218 bytes and a
date of August 8, 1990. Earlier versions of this driver should not be used. This
driver may be obtained from Everex Technical Support at (510) 498-1115, or by
modem from the Everex electronic bulletin board at (510) 226-9694. Installation
instructions are included in the driver package.

According to Everex, there is no similar driver for Windows 3.1. The only
workaround is to select EGA display.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Everex driver package for Windows 3.0 also includes an 800 x 600 16-color
display driver that you can use to obtain higher resolution under Windows. The
800 x 600 driver is not necessary for proper enhanced mode operation.

Install OEM (original equipment manufacturer) VDD files by editing the [386Enh]
section of the Windows 3.0 SYSTEM.INI file. The existing VDD line may read as
follows:

      [386Enh]
      display=*vddvga

This should be changed to read as follows:

      [386Enh]
      display=673win3.exe

Then, the 673WIN3.EXE file should be placed in the SYSTEM subdirectory.
