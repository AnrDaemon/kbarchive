SUMMARY
=======

The README.TXT file included with Microsoft Windows version 3.0 includes the
following incorrect note:

   Setting the D= Switch for EMM386
   --------------------------------
   If you install EMM386, before you can start Windows in 386
   enhanced mode, you must include the following setting on your
   EMM386 command line:

      d=48

The "d=" command-line parameter for EMM386 sets the size of its local DMA buffer.
This parameter is not required to run Windows 3.0 in enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting the "d=" parameter is only necessary if you receive a fatal error from
EMM386 telling you to set this parameter to a specific value. Unless you receive
such a message, do not use this parameter.
