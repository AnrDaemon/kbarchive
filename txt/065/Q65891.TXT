SUMMARY
=======

You can only run one instance of Recorder with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. If
Recorder is already running, and you try to start a second instance of Recorder,
the first instance of Recorder becomes the active window and no second instance
appears.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a macro file is run when the Recorder is running, the Recorder loads that
file. If a macro file is already in the Recorder, and has unsaved changes, the
Recorder brings up a dialog box asking if you want to save changes.
