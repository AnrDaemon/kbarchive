The Microsoft C Compiler version 6.0 includes version 2.5 of HIMEM.SYS.
Because this version implements the XMS 2.0 specification, Windows runs in
standard and 386 enhanced mode with this driver. However, this
configuration is not supported by Microsoft and performance may be reduced.
Windows should be run with version 2.6 of HIMEM.SYS, which is included with
the Windows package. Microsoft C Compiler 6.0 works with version 2.6 of
HIMEM.SYS with no decrease in performance.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a
