The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In the "Microsoft Mail HyperCard Interface Documentation" stack on the
getMessageList card, the documentation incorrectly reads as follows:

   msmail(getMessageList, [typefilter] [subjectfilter]
   [enclosurefilter])

It should read as follows:

   msmail(getMessageList [,typefilter] [,subjectfilter]
   [,enclosurefilter])

All arguments in a msmail function must be separated with a comma. To skip or
omit an argument but use a later argument, a placeholder of "" is required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of omitting an argument:

   get msmail(getMessageList, "", "", "TEXT")

For more information on external functions in HyperCard, see pages 521-566 of
"The Waite Group's Tricks of the HyperTalk Masters" (Hayden Books, 1989).
