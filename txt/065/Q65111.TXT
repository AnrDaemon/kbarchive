SUMMARY
=======

The WriteProfileString function provides a mechanism to maintain the system
profile file WIN.INI. In versions of Windows prior to version 3.0, an
application could call the WriteProfileString function to add entries to WIN.INI
or to modify existing entries. However, to delete an entry from WIN.INI, the
user was required to edit the file manually.

The WriteProfileString function was extended in Windows 3.0 to enable an
application to delete any of the following from WIN.INI:

1. A value associated with a key name.

2. A line that contains a particular key name.

3. An entire section.

This article details the three deletion scenarios mentioned before.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The parameters passed to the WriteProfileString function refer to the following
selection from an example WIN.INI file:

      [MY_APP]
      KeyName = DATA

To delete the line KeyName = DATA, call the WriteProfileString function as
follows:

      WriteProfileString("MY_APP", "KeyName", NULL);

To delete the value DATA, change the call to the following:

      WriteProfileString("MY_APP", "KeyName", "");

To delete the entire MY_APP section, make the following call:

      WriteProfileString("MY_APP", NULL, NULL);
