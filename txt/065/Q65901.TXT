SUMMARY
=======

You may experience problems deleting and displaying empty directories with
Microsoft Windows running on a Novell network if the SHOW DOTS=ON line is not in
the SHELL.CFG file. Specifically, you may get the following error message:

   Error Deleting File   Cannot delete <drive>:\<directory>\*.*.
   Cannot find file; check to ensure the path and filename are correct

This error occurs when you attempt to delete an empty subdirectory using File
Manager on a Novell NetWare server if the SHOW DOTS=ON line is not specified in
the SHELL.CFG file. The variables <drive> and <directory> above
would be replaced by the actual drive and directory name that you are attempting
to delete.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SHOW DOTS=ON line causes the [..] directory entry to be displayed in File
Manager. The SHELL.CFG file must be located in the same directory as IPX.COM and
the NETx.COM file (where x is either 3 or 4 depending on the MS- DOS version in
use). If the SHELL.CFG file does not exist, it can be created using any
nonformatting text editor (such as Notepad) by writing SHOW DOTS=ON and then
saving the file as SHELL.CFG to the appropriate directory.

An additional symptom of not having SHOW DOTS=ON is the error message

   No Files Found
   The directory <drive>:\<directory>\*.* does not contain any files

when you attempt to access an empty directory on the server.
