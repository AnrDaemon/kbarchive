-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, version 5.1 
 - Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) for MS-DOS, version 7.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A customer reported that when using LINK.EXE version 5.10 (the linker that comes
with Microsoft Basic Professional Development System [PDS] version 7.10) on a
workstation running on a 3Com 3+ Open network, the computer may hang if the
linker needs to generate a .TMP file.

If you set the TMP environment variable to a directory on the workstation's own
hard drive, the linker should function correctly.

This information applies to Microsoft Basic PDS version 7.10 and LINK.EXE version
5.10. The problem does not occur when using Microsoft Basic PDS version 7.00 and
LINK.EXE version 5.05.

Please note that Microsoft Basic PDS 7.10 is designed to support only the IBM
PC-NET and MS-NET compatible networks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the linker does not have enough room to work correctly in memory, it will
write a temporary file to disk and display the message:

   Temporary file .\xxxxxxxx has been created

This customer reported that without a TMP environment variable set, the linker
attempted to write the temporary file on the server machine, which hung his
computer. After he added the TMP environment variable and assigned it a path to
a directory on the workstation's own hard drive, the computer did not hang. The
TMP environment variable can be set by either typing a line such as the
following at the DOS prompt or by putting it into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   " TMP=C:\directory name " (without the quotation marks)

The problem only occurred when the workstation was running under DOS. While
running under OS/2 version 1.20, the problem did not occur.

The customer encountered this problem on a workstation with the following
configuration:

   386 Clone 3Com 3+ Open Network version 1.1e DOS 4.01
