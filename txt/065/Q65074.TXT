When you specify the MSDOS.EXE file in the LOAD= line within the
WIN.INI file, MS-DOS Executive loads full screen instead of as an
icon. This contradicts information given in the WININI.TXT file
stating that a Windows application loads as an icon if you specify
its filename in the LOAD= line.

This is by design for the MSDOS.EXE file. The MS-DOS Executive was
the original shell for Windows versions 2.x and was made to load
full screen when you access Windows.
