The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 sets the WINDIR environment variable whenever
any program, including a MS-DOS program, is run under it. WINDIR is set to
the directory where WIN.COM is found. This is usually C:\WINDOWS. The
WINDIR variable is removed from the MS-DOS environment when you exit
Windows.

As a result, MS-DOS applications can detect whether they are running under
Windows. If WINDIR is set to a valid name, the application is running under
Windows.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0 3.0a 3.00a 3.1 3.10 3.11
