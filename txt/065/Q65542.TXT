KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for HyperCard, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When HyperCard version 1.2.2, 1.2.5 or 2.0 is running and the Microsoft Mail
version 2.00 notifier chimes, the chime becomes a continuous beep. To avoid this
problem, choose Preferences from the Mail menu and deselect the Sound Chime
option; if you are using the Microsoft Mail Software Development Kit (SDK) for
HyperCard, you can modify your HyperCard Home Stack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Mail version 2.00. This problem
was corrected in Mail version 3.00.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify your Home Stack to turn the Sound Chime option off when HyperCard
starts, and turn it back on when quitting from HyperCard, do the following:

NOTE: You must be signed in to your Mail account prior to launching HyperCard for
this script to perform properly.

WARNING: If you make a mistake, you may not be able to undo it. Proceed with
caution or work on a copy of the Home Stack.

1. Install the MSMAIL resources into the Home Stack with the Mail Interface
   Documentation Stack. Directions for installation are included within the
   stack.

2. From the Go menu in HyperCard, choose Home.

3. The User Level must be set at Scripting for the next steps. If it is not,
   type "set user level to 5" (without the quotation marks) into the message box
   and press RETURN.

4. From the Objects menu, choose Stack Info.

5. Click Script.

6. Modify the "on startup" routine. Add the following line:

   " get msmail(EnableNotify, "false")" (without the quotation marks)

7. Add a "on quit" routine as follows:

         on doMenu x
           if x = "Quit HyperCard" then get msmail(EnableNotify, "true")
         end doMenu

8. Click OK

9. Quit HyperCard. Reopening HyperCard will turn off the Sound Chime; it will be
   reset when you quit HyperCard.
