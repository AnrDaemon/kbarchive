The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for MS-DOS, versions 1.01, 1.1, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for OS/2, versions 1.01, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.21 
 - Microsoft NMAKE Utility for Windows NT, versions 1.4, 1.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to use an NMAKE default macro fails and NMAKE generates a message
such as the following:

   warning u4006: special macro undefined : '$<'

CAUSE
=====

A space has been inserted between the name of the target and the dependent
extensions in an inference rule.

RESOLUTION
==========

In an inference rule, list the dependent file extension followed by the target
file extension without any intervening embedded spaces.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following makefile examples demonstrate a few of the problems that can
result when spaces are embedded in an inference rule. In both cases below, note
that the embedded spaces cause NMAKE to run commands incorrectly. If you modify
the files to remove the spaces, NMAKE generates the desired commands.

Sample Makefile 1
-----------------

   # The command executed by NMAKE:
   #
   #    cl {.}

   {.}.c {c:\objs\}.obj:
      cl $*

   c:\objs\test.obj: .\test.c

Sample Makefile 2
-----------------

   # The command executed by NMAKE:
   #
   #    cl

   .c .obj:
     cl $<

   ALL: myfile.obj

   myfile.obj: myfile.c

Additional query words: 1.10 1.20 1.30 1.40 1.50
