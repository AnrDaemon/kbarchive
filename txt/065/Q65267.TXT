 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

Windows applications normally start in the directory in which the program files
are located. You may want to have a Windows application start in a different
directory when running under Microsoft Windows version 3.0. To have a Windows
application start up in a different directory, do the following:

1. Verify that the application's directory is listed in the DOS path statement.

2. Verify that an icon exists for this application and that clicking the icon
   runs the application.

3. Highlight the icon and from the Program Manager File menu, choose Properties.

4. Type the path of the new default directory in the command line of the Program
   Item Properties dialog box. For example, type "C:\XLDATA\EXCEL.EXE" (without
   the quotation marks) to have Excel start in the XLDATA directory.

5. At this point, you will get the error message The specified path is invalid."
   Click OK to bypass this message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Program Manager will search for the executable file in the directory
specified in the Command Line entry of the Program Item Properties dialog box.
If the file is not found in that directory, the Program Manager will search the
DOS path, leaving the specified directory as the default.

There are two problems with this technique. First, when the Command Line is
originally entered in the Program Item Properties dialog box, the error message

   The specified path is invalid

will appear. This indicates that Windows cannot find the executable file in the
path specified. This does not prohibit Windows from accepting the entry, and
Windows will add the program item to the group once OK is chosen.

The second drawback is that Windows will use the default application program item
icon instead of the program's actual icon when displaying the program item in
its group within the Program Manager. To correct this behavior, do the
following:

1. Select the icon in Program Manager.

2. From the File menu, choose Properties.

3. Select Change Icon.

4. Type the path to the executable file and press the ENTER key.

Pages 89-91 of the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide" for Windows version 3.0 has
more information about using Windows applications with the Program Manager.

You may also have non-Windows applications start in different directories. The
best method of doing this is to specify the directory you want the application
to start in at the Start-Up Directory box within the PIF file for that
application.
