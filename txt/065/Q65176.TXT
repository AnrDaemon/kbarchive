-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
 - Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a Packard Bell Legend or Victory series computer, and your mouse stops
responding (hangs) when you run Microsoft Windows version 3.0 in standard or 386
enhanced mode.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to an upper memory conflict. The Microsoft mouse driver
loads itself into the upper memory area (UMA) automatically and conflicts with a
Packard Bell device loaded in the same area.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

 - Add x=c600-c7ff to the EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

   -or-

 - Add /E to the MOUSE.EXE command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to force the mouse
   driver to load in conventional memory instead of the UMA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Packard Bell Legend and Victory series computers offer both a PS/2 mouse
port and a serial port. When a Microsoft Mouse is connected to the PS/2 mouse
port, it reacts more quickly than if it were connected to the standard serial
port. According to Packard Bell, this is part of the system design.
