SUMMARY
=======

Question:

Is it necessary to keep mail slots active (that is, specify MAILSLOTS=YES in
LANMAN.INI) if I want to use the DOS LAN Manager APIs?

Response:

If you specify MAILSLOTS=NO, you will lose DOS LAN Manager API support
(KEEPAPIS=YES and MAILSLOTS=NO is considered to be inconsistent).

Additional query words: 2.00 api mailslots
