SUMMARY
=======

You may get the message

   Cannot disable A20

when the HIMEM.SYS file is loaded.

The A20 line is the key to the first 64K of memory above the first megabyte of
memory in the computer (also known as the High Memory Area or HMA). It is
necessary that HIMEM.SYS enable this line; however, it is not necessary that
HIMEM.SYS disable it. If the line cannot be disabled, there is a risk that other
applications will use this line, possibly resulting in damage to HIMEM.SYS code
and a loss of functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two possible causes for this message:

 - Another application is already using the A20 line when HIMEM.SYS tries to
   disable it. Check the CONFIG.SYS file for applications that are using the
   high-memory area (for example, VDISK, old versions of QEMM, or 386 to the
   Max). Either REMark these applications out or ensure HIMEM.SYS is loaded
   first in the CONFIG.SYS. Reboot the machine to check if this solves the
   problem.

 - The hardware in the computer does not support disabling the A20 line.
   Although the problem can be in the design of the motherboard, usually the
   BIOS is responsible. An upgrade of the system BIOS may solve the problem.
   However, if the problem lies in the design of the motherboard, there is no
   workaround for this.
