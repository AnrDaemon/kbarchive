SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Windows Recorder to create a macro that uses the TAB key,
you may experience problems when you use Microsoft Windows Write. For example,
when you use Macro Recorder with Write to make a macro that does the following

   TAB
   TAB
   Yours very truly,
   ENTER
   ENTER
   TAB
   TAB
   John D. Doe

the first two TABS may not work correctly, and ENTER may display as a page break
in certain cases.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known problem with Macro Recorder when you use the macro with Write
and TABs.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Use SHIFT+TAB instead of a TAB.

2. Use SHIFT+ENTER instead of ENTER.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem does not occur in later versions of Windows.
