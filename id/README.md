## KB Articles by Product/Category

Most of the folder names here come from the bracketed keywords on the `DOCUMENT` line of the original
KnowledgeBase TXT files.  For example, this [document](../txt/010/Q10022.TXT) contains:

	DOCUMENT:Q10022  07-SEP-2001  [word97]

so it will be listed in the [word97](word97/) folder.

KB articles from other sources (eg, Microsoft Programmer's Library CD-ROMs) will be filed under a keyword
that describes the source.  For example, this [document](../kb/011/Q11085/) from the `BASIC References` section
of the MSPL 1.3 CD-ROM will be listed in the [mspl13_basic](mspl13_basic/) folder.
